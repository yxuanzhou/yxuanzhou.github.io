        <h3>Fred and Madge</h3>
        <p>Written in 1959 when he was only 26 years old, Fred and Madge was Joe Orton’s very first play and has been rarely produced since its composition. The title characters of the play seem to be the stereotypical middle-aged couple, bored with one another and conversing in clichés. But it turns out that Fred’s job is to push boulders uphill like Sisyphus and Madge’s is to sieve water all day long. Furthermore, since the action is repeatedly interrupted by a quasi-director, it seems they are inhabiting a play about themselves. Soon, it becomes clear that London is becoming subsumed by rampant greenery and the whole cast dreams of escape. Orton’s play zings with sharp one-liners and dialogue that reeks of sexual and social innuendo – a foretaste of his inimitable theatrical style that would eventually turn him into one of Britain’s best-loved playwrights. Fred and Madge fuses anger with absurdity in its portrait of a working-class couple dehumanised by the relentless routine of their mundane lives. These routines are paralleled by the rituals of the theatre itself, something with which Orton was all too familiar.</p>

        <h3>Loot</h3>
        <p>A black farce masterpiece, Loot follows the fortunes and misfortunes of two young amateur thieves, Hal and Dennis. Dennis is a hearse driver for an undertaker. They have robbed the bank next door to the funeral parlour and have returned to Hal's home to hide-out with the loot. Hal's mother has just died and the pair conceal the money in her coffin, hiding the body in a cupboard. Unluckily the body is discovered by the predatory Fay, who had been nursing Hal’s mother and has now very quickly engaged herself to marry his father. With the arrival of Inspector Truscott, who insists on posing as a man from the Water Board, the thickened plot turns topsy-turvy. Playing with all the conventions of popular farce, Orton creates a world gone mad and examines in detail English attitudes at mid-century. Loot was first staged in 1965 at Cambridge, and though the first production was not a success, the play soon received acclaim as a masterwork of dark farce and morbid comedy.</p>

        <h3>Entertaining Mr Sloane</h3>
        <p>Sharp, alarming and hilarious, Entertaining Mr Sloane is a subversive black comedy of unscrupulous sexual manipulation. In three deft acts, Orton tells the mischievously provocative story of Mr Sloane, a sly and handsome young man who works his way into the household of Kath, her brother Ed, and their father. Kath wants something between a lover and a substitute baby, while Ed wants someone to drive his car dressed in a tight t-shirt and leather cap. But though the charismatic youth thinks that he holds all the cards with both brother and sister vying for his attention, the play soon becomes a shameless and unnerving tangle of sex, blackmail, bribery and violence.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
        <h3>The Visitors</h3>
        <p>The Visitors was written in 1961, and was the last play Orton wrote before his breakthrough. The Visitors was rejected by both the BBC and the Royal Court. Whilst admiring the dialogue, they felt the plot was unstructured. Set in a hospital where Kemp is visited by his middle-aged daughter, Mrs Platt, the nursing staff are more intent on betting and gossip than patient care and Mrs Platt speaks to her dying father in petty clichés. The Visitors introduces the father and daughter characters later reworked and developed into Kemp and Kath in Entertaining Mr Sloane.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
        <h3>What the Butler Saw</h3>
        <p>Orton’s masterpiece of farce is set in a psychiatrist’s office in which sanity is hard to come by. Studded with Orton’s inimitable epigrams and subversive wit, it is a precise frenzy of nudity, sexuality, accidental transvestism and manic pursuit. Orton is always on the attack, parodying psychology, society and farce, even as his characters fall head over heels into farcical panic. The seed of all the play’s misunderstandings is Dr Prentice’s insistence that interviewing the young Geraldine for a secretarial position involves a full examination in the nude. The interview is interrupted by Mrs Prentice, accompanied by a hotel porter who has her wig, dress and some incriminating photographs. They are interrupted in turn by Rance, who has come to inspect the institution and diagnose everyone in sight with elaborate mental confusions. The characters are forced into increasingly ludicrous contortions and excuses, as the lies and disguises are endlessly escalated into a perfectly plotted climax.</p>
