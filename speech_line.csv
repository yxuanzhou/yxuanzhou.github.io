S1000003,P003,C0001,KATH,,This is my lounge.
S1000005,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Oh, yes. (Pause.) You mustn’t imagine it’s always like this. You ought to have rung up or something. And then I’d’ve been prepared."
S1000007,P003,C0001,KATH,,I never showed you the toilet.
S1000009,P003,C0001,KATH,,I should change them curtains. Those are our winter ones. The summer ones are more of a chintz. (Laughs.) The walls need re-doing. The Dadda has trouble with his eyes. I can’t ask him to do any work involving ladders. It stands to reason.
S1000011,P003,C0001,KATH,,I don’t want to rush you. (Pause.) What do you think? I’d be happy to have you.
S1000013,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(pause) I was. I had a boy … killed in very sad circumstances. It broke my heart at the time. I got over it though. You do, don’t you?"
S1000015,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes.
S1000017,P003,C0001,KATH,,I don’t let myself go like some of them you may have noticed. I’m just over … As a matter of fact I’m forty-one.
S1000019,P003,C0001,KATH,,Will you?
S1000021,P003,C0001,KATH,,Was it bad?
S1000023,P003,C0001,KATH,,As bad as that?
S1000025,P003,C0001,KATH,,I don’t suppose I have. I’ve led a sheltered life.
S1000027,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes a long time. My husband was a mere boy. (With a half-laugh.) That sounds awful doesn’t it?
S1000029,P003,C0001,KATH,,I married out of school. I surprised everyone by the suddenness of it. (Pause.) Does that sound as if I had to get married?
S1000031,P003,C0001,KATH,,I should’ve known better. You won’t breathe a word?
S1000033,P003,C0001,KATH,,My brother would be upset if he knew I told you. (Pause.) Nobody knows around here. The people in the nursing home imagined I was somebody. I didn’t disillusion them.
S1000035,P003,C0001,KATH,,No.
S1000037,P003,C0001,KATH,,I wouldn’t for a minute. What about –?
S1000039,P003,C0001,KATH,,(pause) We always planned to marry. But there were difficulties. I was very young and he was even younger. I don’t believe we would have been allowed.
S1000041,P003,C0001,KATH,,Adopted.
S1000043,P003,C0001,KATH,,That I could not say. My brother arranged it.
S1000045,P003,C0001,KATH,,He couldn’t do anything.
S1000047,P003,C0001,KATH,,"His family objected. They were very nice but he had a duty you see. (Pause.) As I say, if it’d been left to him I’d be his widow today. (Pause.) I had a last letter. I’ll show you some time. (Silence.) D’you like flock or foam rubber in your pillow?"
S1000049,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You need a bit of luxury, don’t you? I bought the Dadda one but he can’t stand them."
S1000051,P003,C0001,KATH,,You’ll live with us then as one of the family?
S1000053,P003,C0001,KATH,,Didn’t you?
S1000055,P003,C0001,KATH,,You have the air of lost wealth.
S1000057,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did Dr Barnardo give you a bad time?
S1000059,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did you never know your mamma?
S1000061,P003,C0001,KATH,,When did they die?
S1000063,P003,C0001,KATH,,How shocking.
S1000065,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Of course not. (Pause.) With a nice lad like you to take care of you’d think they’d’ve postponed it. (Pause.) Criminals, were they?"
S1000067,P003,C0001,KATH,,Do you? How nice.
S1000069,P003,C0001,KATH,,Marble? (Pause.) Is there an inscription?
S1000071,P003,C0001,KATH,,We’ll see.
S1000073,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes.
S1000075,P003,C0001,KATH,,Any relations?
S1000077,P003,C0001,KATH,,Poor boy. Alone in the world. Like me.
S1000079,P003,C0001,KATH,,I am. (Pause.) Almost alone. (Pause.) If I’d been allowed to keep my boy I’d not be. (Pause.) You’re almost the same age as he would be. You’ve got the same refinement.
S1000081,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You do, don’t you? Here let me take your coat. (Helps him off with his coat.) You’ve got a delicate skin. (Touches his neck. His cheek.)"
S1000082,P003,C0001,KATH,,(kisses his cheek) Just a motherly kiss. A real mother’s kiss. (Silence. Lifts his arms and folds them about her.) You’ll find me very sentimental. I upset easy. (His arms are holding her.) When I hear of… tragedies happening to perfect strangers. There are so many ruined lives. (Puts her head on his shoulder.) You must treat me gently when I'm in one of my moods.
S1000084,P003,C0001,KATH,,We’ll come to some arrangement. A cup of tea?
S1000086,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’ll get you one.
S1000088,P003,C0001,KATH,,Now?
S1000090,P003,C0001,KATH,,You must do as you think fit.
S1000093,P003,C0001,KATH,,(calls) I’m in here. Don’t stand about. Sit down. Go on. We don’t charge.
S1000095,P003,C0001,KATH,,A visitor.
S1000097,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You are the limit. You show me up no end. It isn’t ED. (Pause.) You behave like a sick child. I’m just about tired of it. Afraid to have a guest or a friend in the house. You put them off, Dadda. Let him shake your hand. Go on."
S1000100,P003,C0001,KATH,,Mr SLOANE is going to stay with us.
S1000102,P003,C0001,KATH,,That’s what I said.
S1000104,P003,C0001,KATH,,Make an effort will you? What will the gentleman think? He’ll think you’re a rude old man. (Exchanges looks with SLOANE
S1000106,P003,C0001,KATH,,"No, it isn’t. (To KEMP"
S1000222,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(runs on, drying her hands on her apron, sees SLOANE"
S1000224,P003,C0001,KATH,,(shoos him away) Is there pain?
S1000226,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you hurt bad?
S1000228,P003,C0001,KATH,,Come on. You’ll be better on the settee. (He allows her to guide him over. She settles him.) What happened? Did he attack you? He’s never shown signs before.
S1000230,P003,C0001,KATH,,Let Mr SLOANE speak for himself.
S1000232,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Throw them, did he?"
S1000234,P003,C0001,KATH,,"I’m ashamed of you, Dadda. Really ashamed. I think you behave very badly. Lie down, Mr SLOANE"
S1000237,P003,C0001,KATH,,"I will. (Goes to the sideboard and rummages in a drawer. Rummages again. Repeat. Second drawer. Takes out and places on top of the sideboard a Boots folder containing snapshots and negatives, a reel of cotton, a piece of unfinished knitting, a tattered knitting pattern, a broken china figure, a magazine, a doorknob and several pieces of silk.)"
S1000239,P003,C0001,KATH,,(runs back with a piece of silk. Lifts his leg. Spreads the silk under the bloody patch) This’ll do. It’s a piece of material my brother brought back. It’s good stuff. I was intending to make a blouse but there’s not enough.
S1000241,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(shouting) What are you doing, Dadda? He gets that thick. (Goes to sideboard.)"
S1000242,P003,C0001,KATH,,(takes it from him) You done enough damage for one day. Make yourself scarce.
S1000243,P003,C0001,KATH,,What a lovely pair of shoes you got. (Unlacing his shoes she takes them off and places them under the settee.)
S1000245,P003,C0001,KATH,,"I wonder, Mr SLOANE"
S1000246,P003,C0001,KATH,,That’s right. (Pause.) Where is it then?
S1000248,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He attacked you from behind? If you ask me it’s only a deep scratch. (Pause.) I don’t think we’ll require outside assistance. (Pause.) Don’t be embarrassed, Mr SLOANE"
S1000250,P003,C0001,KATH,,Just the thing for the germs. (Pause.) You’ve a skin on you like a princess. Better than on those tarts you see dancing about on the telly. I like a lad with a smooth body. (Stops dabbing his leg. Takes up the bandage. Rises. Fetches a pair of scissors. Cuts bandage. Ties it round SLOANE
S1000252,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Attractive, though."
S1000254,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes. You being a blond.
S1000256,P003,C0001,KATH,,Nature’s a funny thing.
S1000258,P003,C0001,KATH,,Keep your voice down. (Pause.) It’s probably her from the shops. I’ll not answer it. She’s only got one subject for talk.
S1000260,P003,C0001,KATH,,Not if you keep your voice down.
S1000262,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He won’t answer. I don’t want her in here. She tells everybody her business. And if she found me in this predicament she’d think all kinds of things. (Pause.) Her daughter’s involved in a court case at the moment. Tells every detail. The details are endless. I suffer as she recounts. Oh, Mr SLOANE"
S1000264,P003,C0001,KATH,,I wouldn’t want to restrict your circulation.
S1000266,P003,C0001,KATH,,"I’ll sponge these, and there’s a nick in the material. I’ll fix it. (Puts Dettol, bandage, etc, into the sideboard.) This drawer is my medicine cabinet, dear. If you wants an occasional aspirin help yourself. (She comes back.)"
S1000267,P003,C0001,KATH,,(confidentially) I’ve been doing my washing today and I haven’t a stitch on… except my shoes… I’m in the rude under this dress. I tell you because you’re bound to have noticed …
S1000269,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Yes. You’ll notice the length? I’ve got long legs. Long, elegant legs. (Kicks out her leg.) I could give one or two of them a surprise. (Pause.) My look is quite different when I’m in private. (Leans over him.) You can’t see through this dress can you? I been worried for fear of embarrassing you."
S1000270,P003,C0001,KATH,,(leaps back) Mr SLOANE – don’t betray your trust
S1000272,P003,C0001,KATH,,I know what you thought. You wanted to see if my titties were all my own. You’re all the same. (Smirks.) I must be careful of you. Have me naked on the floor if I give you a chance. If my brother was to know … (Pause.) … he’s such a possessive man. (Silence. Stands up.) Would you like to go to bed?
S1000274,P003,C0001,KATH,,You need rest. You’ve had a shock. (Pause.) I’ll bring your supper to your room.
S1000276,P003,C0001,KATH,,The Dadda will fetch it. (Pause.) Can you get up the stairs on your own?
S1000278,P003,C0001,KATH,,(motions him back. Stands in front of him) Just a minute. (Calls). Dadda! (Pause.) Dadda!
S1000280,P003,C0001,KATH,,Turn your face away. Mr SLOANE is passing. He has no trousers on. (Quietly to SLOANE
S1000282,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(calling after him) Have a bath if you want to, dear. Treat the conveniences as if they were your own. (Turns to KEMP"
S1000284,P003,C0001,KATH,,Don’t KATH
S1000286,P003,C0001,KATH,,Upset you? A grown man?
S1000288,P003,C0001,KATH,,You’ve seen the milkman before. That’s no cause to throw the shears at him.
S1000290,P003,C0001,KATH,,Oh? I heard different. (Picks up her handbag and takes out money.) Go and fetch his case. It’ll be about five pence on the bus.
S1000292,P003,C0001,KATH,,(losing her temper) By the Co-op! Behave yourself.
S1000294,P003,C0001,KATH,,That’s the one. Only it is closed. (Pause.) Can you find it?
S1000296,P003,C0001,KATH,,(goes to the window. Over her shoulder) It’s ED die.
S1000298,P003,C0001,KATH,,(speaking to someone outside) Why don’t you come round the right way?
S1000300,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you coming in?
S1000302,P003,C0001,KATH,,It’s ED die.
S1000304,P003,C0001,KATH,,I don’t expect he wants you to.
S1000306,P003,C0001,KATH,,Tell him what?
S1000311,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Do what I told you, Dadda. Try not to lose yourself. Follow the railings. Then ask somebody."
S1000313,P003,C0001,KATH,,What?
S1000315,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Yes, ED die, I’m listening."
S1000317,P003,C0001,KATH,,No …
S1000319,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s a guest. He’s not a lodger.
S1000321,P003,C0001,KATH,,I needed a bit extra.
S1000323,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’m taking Dadda away next year.
S1000325,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s a nice young man.
S1000327,P003,C0001,KATH,,No.
S1000329,P003,C0001,KATH,,"No, ED die."
S1000331,P003,C0001,KATH,,(uneasy) I’m not like that.
S1000333,P003,C0001,KATH,,This young man is quite respectable.
S1000335,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s young.
S1000337,P003,C0001,KATH,,No.
S1000339,P003,C0001,KATH,,Mr SLOANE is superior to that.
S1000341,P003,C0001,KATH,,In the library.
S1000343,P003,C0001,KATH,,He was having trouble. With his rent. (Pause.) His landlady was unscrupulous.
S1000345,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s a good boy.
S1000346,P003,C0001,KATH,,It was an accident.
S1000348,P003,C0001,KATH,,Upstairs.
S1000350,P003,C0001,KATH,,He hurt his leg.
S1000352,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s resting. (Pause.) ED， you won’t tell him to go?
S1000354,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’m not misbehaving. ED， if you send him away I shall cry.
S1000357,P003,C0001,KATH,,(off) Mr SLOANE
S1000359,P003,C0001,KATH,,Let him stay.
S1000361,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He’s cultured, ED. He’s informed."
S1000362,P003,C0001,KATH,,"This is my brother, Mr SLOANE"
S1000377,P003,C0001,KATH,,No.
S1000379,P003,C0001,KATH,,I made them this morning.

S1000483,P003,C0001,KATH,,Send him a card?
S1000485,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’d like to. I’d show you beforehand. (Pause.) Can I go to his mamma’s grave?

S1000489,P003,C0001,KATH,,Where?
S1000491,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are your friends nice?
S1000493,P003,C0001,KATH,,No ladies?
S1000495,P003,C0001,KATH,,Ladies are nice at a gathering.
S1000497,P003,C0001,KATH,,They add colour and gaiety.
S1000499,P003,C0001,KATH,,I hope you have a nice time. Perhaps one day you’ll invite me to your hotel.
S1000501,P003,C0001,KATH,,Show me round.
S1000503,P003,C0001,KATH,,Is it exquisitely furnished? High up?
S1000506,P003,C0001,KATH,,Speak to him Dadda. He’s something to ask you.
S1000508,P003,C0001,KATH,,Come again.

S1000517,P003,C0001,KATH,,Let me phone.
S1000519,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(tearfully) Oh, Dadda, you are unfair. If you don’t speak to him he won’t invite me to his suite. It’s a condition. I won’t be able to go. You found that address?"
S1000521,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Why didn’t you ask? (Pause.) You had a tongue in your head. Oh, Dadda, you make me so angry with your silly ways. (Pause.) What was the house like?"
S1000523,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He said it was a hovel. A boy like him shouldn’t be expected to live with the rougher elements. Do you know, Dadda, he has skin the like of which I never felt before. And he confesses to being an orphan. His story is so sad. I wept when I heard it. You know how soft-hearted I am."
S1000525,P003,C0001,KATH,,Have you seen the optician?
S1000527,P003,C0001,KATH,,Without a word of a lie you are like a little child.

S1000531,P003,C0001,KATH,,Where to?
S1000533,P003,C0001,KATH,,Too cold.
S1000535,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’d always consult you first.
S1000537,P003,C0001,KATH,,You ought to consult an oculist. See your oculist at once. (Pause.) Go to bed. I’ll bring you a drinkie. In the morning you’ll feel different.
S1000539,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’ve never stopped loving you.
S1000541,P003,C0001,KATH,,(angrily) You’ve been at that ham haven’t you? Half a jar of pickles you’ve put away. Don’t moan to me if you’re up half the night with the tummy ache. I’ve got no sympathy for you.
S1000543,P003,C0001,KATH,,"(watches him out of the door. Looks through into the kitchen) All right, Mr SLOANE"
S1000545,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You have? I’m so glad. I don’t want to disturb you at your food. (Sees knitting on sideboard, picks it up.) Come into the lounge if you wish. I'm just at a quiet bit of knitting before I go to bed."
S1000547,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’ll give you a splendid breakfast in the morning. (Realizes that there is only one needle in the knitting. Searches in the junk and finds the other. Takes it to the settee. SLOANE sits on one end.) (Pause.) Isn’t this room gorgeous?
S1000549,P003,C0001,KATH,,That vase over there come from Bombay. Do you have any interest in that part of the world?
S1000551,P003,C0001,KATH,,Ah … it’s all the same. I don’t suppose they know the difference themselves. Are you comfortable? Let me plump your cushion. (Plumps a cushion behind his head. Laughs lightly.) I really by rights should ask you to change places. This light is showing me up. (Pause.) I blame it on the manufacturers. They make garments so thin nowadays you’d think they intended to provoke a rape.
S1000553,P003,C0001,KATH,,(breaks away) I hope I’m not. I was trying to find the letter from my little boy’s father. I treasure it. But I seem to have mislaid it. I found a lot of photos though.
S1000555,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you interested in looking through them? (Brings the snapshots over.)
S1000557,P003,C0001,KATH,,My lover.
S1000559,P003,C0001,KATH,,It brings back memories. He reminds me of you. (Pause.) He too was handsome and in the prime of manhood. Can you wonder I fell. (Pause.) I wish he were here now to love and protect me. (Leans her arm on his shoulder. Shows him another snap.) This is me. I was younger then.
S1000561,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes my hair was nice.
S1000563,P003,C0001,KATH,,An’ this … I don’t know whether I ought to let you see it.
S1000565,P003,C0001,KATH,,That seat is erected to the memory of Mrs Gwen Lewis. She was a lady who took a lot of trouble with invalids. (Pause.) It was near that seat that my baby was thought of.
S1000567,P003,C0001,KATH,,(shyly) Not on it exactly. Nearby …
S1000569,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes. (Pause.) He was rough with me.
S1000571,P003,C0001,KATH,,I couldn’t describe my feelings. (Pause.) I don’t think the fastening on this thing I'm wearing will last much longer. (The snapshots slip from her hand.) There! you’ve knocked the photos on the floor.
S1000576,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Shopping, dear. Did you want me?"
S1000578,P003,C0001,KATH,,(goes to the window. Takes off her headscarf) What’s ED die doing?
S1000580,P003,C0001,KATH,,But that’s your job.
S1000582,P003,C0001,KATH,,Poor boy. (Pause.) Go and help him. For mamma’s sake.

S1000586,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you too tired?
S1000588,P003,C0001,KATH,,We must make allowances for you. You’re young. (Pause.) You’re not taking advantage are you?
S1000590,P003,C0001,KATH,,I know you aren’t. When you’ve had a drinkie go and help him.
S1000592,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did mamma hear you were on the razzle?
S1000594,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did you go up West? You were late coming home. (Pause.) Very late.

S1000602,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did you ask him? He would have come.
S1000604,P003,C0001,KATH,,Ask him next time.
S1000606,P003,C0001,KATH,,I hope you behaved yourself.
S1000608,P003,C0001,KATH,,Take no notice of her. She might not be nice.

S1000622,P003,C0001,KATH,,Stop it. It’s rude. Did she teach you to say that?
S1000624,P003,C0001,KATH,,What you just said.
S1000625,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You’re spoiling yourself in my eyes, Mr SLOANE. You won’t ring this girl will you?"
S1000627,P003,C0001,KATH,,Decide now. To please me. I don’t know what you see in these girls. You have your friends for company.
S1000629,P003,C0001,KATH,,What’s wrong with them? You can talk freely. Not like with a lady.
S1000631,P003,C0001,KATH,,She might be after your money.

S1000645,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Oh, no!"
S1000647,P003,C0001,KATH,,Don’t think of such drastic action. I’d never forgive myself if I drove you away. (Pause.) I won’t any more.

S1001264,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He can be aggravating I know, but you shouldn’t resort to violence, dear. (Pause.) Did he insult you? (Pause.) Was it a bad word? (Pause.) I don’t expect you can tell me what it was. I’d blush."
S1001266,P003,C0001,KATH,,You’re exaggerating. You’re not that type of young man. (Pause.) But don’t do it again. Mamma wouldn’t like it. (EDenters.) Is he all right?

S1001342,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Oh, I said he had no proof. I didn’t waste my energy listening to him. Sometimes I think he makes up these things to frighten me. He ought to curb his imagination. (Exits.)"

S1001505,P003,C0001,KATH,,Doctors don’t do that. He wants to stay.
S1001509,P003,C0001,KATH,,ED –
S1001511,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’ve something to tell you.
S1001513,P003,C0001,KATH,,Mr SLOANE was nice to me. Aren’t you shocked?
S1001515,P003,C0001,KATH,,Aren’t you angry with Mr SLOANE
S1001517,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you?
S1001519,P003,C0001,KATH,,What did he explain?
S1001521,P003,C0001,KATH,,I didn’t carry on! What a wicked thing to say.
S1001523,P003,C0001,KATH,,Did he say that?
S1001525,P003,C0001,KATH,,Mr SLOANE
S1001527,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He gave me a locket. (She takes off the locket. SLOANE attempts to take it.) I don’t believe he’d take it if you weren’t here, ED. (She puts the locket back. To SLOANE"
S1001529,P003,C0001,KATH,,That’s neither here nor there. Using expressions like that. Making yourself cheap. (SLOANE turns to the suitcase.) I see the truth of the matter. He’s been at you. Isn’t that like him?
S1001531,P003,C0001,KATH,,Let him decide for himself.
S1001533,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’m afraid you’re unduly influencing him.

S1001541,P003,C0001,KATH,,A woman knows when she’s loved.
S1001543,P003,C0001,KATH,,My character will stand analysis.
S1001545,P003,C0001,KATH,,I’m a benign influence. A source of good.
S1001547,P003,C0001,KATH,,Who tucks him up at night? And he likes my cooking. He won’t deny that.
S1001549,P003,C0001,KATH,,See I’m right.
S1001551,P003,C0001,KATH,,You can’t.
S1001553,P003,C0001,KATH,,I do.
S1001555,P003,C0001,KATH,,What is that?
S1001557,P003,C0001,KATH,,I keep his trousers pressed nice. He’s been smarter since I knew him.
S1001559,P003,C0001,KATH,,I gave him everything.
S1001561,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s lovely with me. Charming little baby he is.
S1001563,P003,C0001,KATH,,I gave him three meals a day. Porridge for breakfast. Meat and two veg for dinner. A fry for tea. And cheese for supper. What more could he want?
S1001565,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’s free with me.
S1001567,P003,C0001,KATH,,It’s natural.
S1001569,P003,C0001,KATH,,What are you going to give him?

S1001577,P003,C0001,KATH,,"You’re silly, ED die, silly …"
S1001581,P003,C0001,KATH,,Is it the colour of the curtains in your room?
S1001583,P003,C0001,KATH,,Is it because I’m pregnant?
S1001585,P003,C0001,KATH,,You vowed you loved me.
S1001587,P003,C0001,KATH,,I was kind to you.
S1001589,P003,C0001,KATH,,Are you grateful?
S1001591,P003,C0001,KATH,,I paid too. Baby on the way. Reputation ruined.
S1001593,P003,C0001,KATH,,Is that what he’s taught you?
S1001595,P003,C0001,KATH,,He’d packed the experience of a lifetime into a few short years.
S1001597,P003,C0001,KATH,,I attracted him instantly.
S1001599,P003,C0001,KATH,,He wanted to marry me.
S1001601,P003,C0001,KATH,,We were to ask your consent.

S1001608,P003,C0001,KATH,,It’s baby coming.
S1001610,P003,C0001,KATH,,He said I was a Venus. I held him in my arms.
S1001612,P003,C0001,KATH,,He wanted for nothing. I loved him sincerely.

S1001622,P003,C0001,KATH,,Why didn’t you tell me?

S1001637,P003,C0001,KATH,,What story?
S1001639,P003,C0001,KATH,,I shall never under any circumstances allow anyone to perjure me. It was murder.
S1001641,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Ah, you know as well as I he was perfectly healthy this morning."
S1001643,P003,C0001,KATH,,"He wasn’t there, dear. Respect the truth always. It’s the least you can do under the circumstances."
S1001645,P003,C0001,KATH,,It’s not in accordance with my ideas of morality.
S1001647,P003,C0001,KATH,,When doctor comes he’ll want to know things. Are you asking me to deceive our G.P.? He’s an extremely able man. He’ll notice discrepancies. And then where will we be? He’d make his report and mamma would be behind bars. I’m sure that isn’t your idea. Is it?
S1001649,P003,C0001,KATH,,He must decide for himself. I won’t practise a falsehood.
S1001651,P003,C0001,KATH,,You know how I go to pieces under cross-examination.

S1001671,P003,C0001,KATH,,We talked only of you. I could hardly give credence to the report of your crimes. I didn’t believe the old man. I’m paid for it now.

S1001675,P003,C0001,KATH,,Hold me tight again.

S1001687,P003,C0001,KATH,,What’s he doing then?
S1001692,P003,C0001,KATH,,Make him stop! I shall be sick. He’s upsetting my insides.
S1001694,P003,C0001,KATH,,"My teeth! (She claps a hand over her mouth.) My teeth. (SLOANE flings her from him. She crawls round the floor, searching.) He’s broke my teeth! Where are they?"
S1001696,P003,C0001,KATH,,(reaching under the settee) I’ll still forgive and forget.
S1001707,P003,C0001,KATH,,It’s his nerves. He doesn’t know what he’s doing.

S1001748,P003,C0001,KATH,,As long as he stays here.
S1001750,P003,C0001,KATH,,Aren’t you?
S1001752,P003,C0001,KATH,,For how long?
S1001754,P003,C0001,KATH,,How long is that?
S1001756,P003,C0001,KATH,,"That’s too long, dear. I get so lonely."
S1001758,P003,C0001,KATH,,Yes.
S1001760,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Perfect, ED die. It’s very clever of you to have thought of such a lovely idea!"
S1001762,P003,C0001,KATH,,Can he be present at the birth of his child?
S1001764,P003,C0001,KATH,,It deepens the relationship if the father is there.
S1001766,P003,C0001,KATH,,It was his present to me.
S1001768,P003,C0001,KATH,,"Yes, ED."
S1000004,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Would I be able to use this room? Is it included?
S1000006,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,The bedroom was perfect.
S1000008,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m sure it will be satisfactory. (Walks around the room examining the furniture. Stops by the window.)
S1000010,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I can’t give you a decision right away.
S1000012,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Are you married?
S1000014,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A son?
S1000016,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You don’t look old enough.
S1000018,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(briskly) I’ll take the room.
S1000020,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’ll bring my things over tonight. It’ll be a change from my previous.
S1000022,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Bad?
S1000024,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You’ve no idea.
S1000026,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Have you been a widow long?
S1000028,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Not at all.
S1000030,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m broadminded.
S1000032,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You can trust me.
S1000034,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You were never married then?
S1000036,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What about – I hope you don’t think I’m prying?
S1000038,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,… the father?
S1000040,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What happened to the baby?
S1000042,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,By whom?
S1000044,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What about the kid’s father?
S1000046,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why not?
S1000048,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Foam rubber.
S1000050,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I can.
S1000052,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I never had no family of my own.
S1000054,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No. I was brought up in an orphanage.
S1000056,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"That’s remarkable. My parents, I believe, were extremely wealthy people."
S1000058,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No. It was the lack of privacy I found most trying.
S1000060,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000062,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I was eight. (Pause.) They passed away together.
S1000064,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’ve an idea that they had a suicide pact. Couldn’t prove it of course.
S1000066,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"From what I remember they was respected. You know, H.P. debts. Bridge. A little light gardening. The usual activities of a cultured community. (Silence.) I respect their memory."
S1000068,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Every year I pay a visit to their grave. I take sandwiches. Make a day of it. (Pause.) The graveyard is situated in pleasant surroundings so it’s no hardship. (Pause.) Tomb an’ all.
S1000070,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Perhaps you’d come with me this trip?
S1000072,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I go in the autumn because I clean the leaves off the monument. As a tribute.
S1000074,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,That’s the main task I set myself.
S1000076,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,None.
S1000078,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You’re not alone.
S1000080,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(slowly) I need … understanding.
S1000083,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(clearing his throat) How much are you charging? I mean – I’ve got to know.
S1000085,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes I don’t mind.
S1000087,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Can I have a bath?
S1000089,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Later would do.
S1000105,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s all right.
S1000108,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Haven’t we met before?
S1000110,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Your face is familiar. Have I seen your photo in the paper? In connexion with some event?
S1000112,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Do you pop into the pub at the end of the road?
S1000114,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Are you a churchgoer?
S1000116,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’ve seen you somewhere. I very rarely forget a face.
S1000118,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Perhaps.
S1000120,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(Pause) You don’t resent my being in the house, do you?"
S1000122,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I thought you did. Just now.
S1000124,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,This seems a nice place. Friendly atmosphere. (Pause.) How many children have you?
S1000126,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Is your daughter married?
S1000128,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"You have a son, don’t you?"
S1000130,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How long is it?
S1000132,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,‘Strewth!
S1000134,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I do actually. Not speaking for twenty years? That’s coming it a bit strong.
S1000136,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I can believe that.
S1000138,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Is that straight?
S1000140,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"A puritan, are you?"
S1000142,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"That kind of thing happens often, I believe. For myself, I usually lock the door."
S1000144,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Anticipating some such tendencies on his part?
S1000146,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,There are fascinating possibilities in this situation. I’d get it down on paper if I were you. (Goes to the window.)
S1000148,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A perfect skyline you’ve got here. Lord Snowdon would give you something for a shot of that. Stunning it is. Stunning. Was this house a speculation?
S1000150,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Who built it then? Was he a mad financier? The bloke who conceived the idea of building a house in the midst of a rubbish dump?
S1000152,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Go on. What happened?
S1000154,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Lost interest?
S1000156,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What a way to carry on!
S1000158,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What you want is someone with pull on the council.
S1000160,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Wealthy, was he?"
S1000162,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How old was he?
S1000164,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Early middle-age?
S1000166,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Dead, is he?"
S1000168,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Did he die for his country?
S1000170,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A murderer not brought to justice. That’s a sobering thought. (Pause.) Why can’t they find the murderer? Didn’t they advertise?
S1000172,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How long ago was all this?
S1000174,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Do they have any clue to the murderer’s identity?
S1000176,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(pause) Was your boss a small man?
S1000178,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What was his profession?
S1000180,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You were employed in his service?
S1000182,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(pause) You saw him then?
S1000184,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why didn’t you go to the police?
S1000186,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I see your point of view. (Pause.) They won’t find the killer now.
S1000188,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"No, the scent’s gone cold."
S1000190,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I thought it was your first time from the way you’re messing that about.
S1000192,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why?
S1000194,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What for?
S1000196,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"No, Pop. I’m convinced we haven’t. I must have been getting you mixed up with a man called Fergusson. He had the same kind of way with him. Trustworthy."
S1000198,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes (Laughs.)
S1000200,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Where from?
S1000203,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What’s this!
S1000205,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’ve never met you.
S1000207,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Your eyes aren’t good.

S1000215,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Go on, you superannuated old prat!"
S1000217,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why don’t you shut your mouth and give your arse a chance?

S1000220,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(sinks into an armchair) I’ll be in a wheelchair for life. (Examines his leg.) Oh, you cow. I’m covered in blood! Call somebody!"
S1000225,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I can’t move.
S1000227,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"He’s got an artery. I must be losing pints. Oh, Christ!"
S1000231,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,He ought to be in Colney Hatch. He’s a slate off. Throwing things about.
S1000233,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I don’t know what he did.
S1000236,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Can you get a bandage?

S1000240,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What’s he doing with that Dettol? Is he gone to Swansea for it?

S1000249,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Ouch!
S1000251,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Eh?

S1000259,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She’ll hear.
S1000261,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What about Pop?
S1000263,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000265,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s O.K.
S1000268,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Is it yours?
S1000271,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I just thought –
S1000273,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s early.
S1000275,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What about my case?
S1000277,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Mmmm.
S1000281,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000365,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(smiling) Oh, yes?"
S1000367,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000369,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Just boys.

S1000383,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She seems all right.
S1000385,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I see.
S1000387,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,But I like it here.
S1000389,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She mentioned it.
S1000391,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Said she married young.

S1000407,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I help out. On Saturdays.
S1000409,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,That’s decent of you.
S1000411,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What’s within reason?
S1000413,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(relaxing) I was going to suggest an Aston Martin.
S1000415,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I am.
S1000417,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Never worked in a shop in my life.
S1000419,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I help out on Saturdays for a mate of mine. Len. You might know him. Lifeguard at the baths one time. Nice chap.
S1000421,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I like a plunge now and then.
S1000423,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,We had a nice little gym at the orphanage. Put me in all the teams they did. Relays …

S1000459,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What about?
S1000461,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m looking forward to it.
S1000463,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,When I’m not in training.

S1000568,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,In the bushes? …
S1000570,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Uncomfortable, eh?"
S1000573,P003,C0002,SLOANE,KATH,"You should wear more clothes, Mr SLOANE. I believe you’re as naked as me. And there’s no excuse for it. (Silence.) I’ll be your mamma. I need to be loved. Gently. Oh! I shall be so ashamed in the morning. (Switches off the light.) What a big heavy baby you are. Such a big heavy baby."
S1000575,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Where you been?
S1000577,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I couldn’t find you.
S1000579,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A bit of serviceing.
S1000581,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I was on the beer. My guts is playing up.
S1000583,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I may go in a bit.
S1000585,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.

S1000593,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000595,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Three of my mates and me had a night out.
S1000597,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,We have interests in common.
S1000599,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Not on your life. They’re gentle. Refined youths. Thorpe, Beck and Doolan. We toured the nighteries in the motor."
S1000601,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000603,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,He was tired. A hard day yesterday.
S1000605,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"We ended up at a fabulous place. Soft music, pink shades, lovely atmosphere."
S1000607,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,One of the hostesses gave me her number. Told me to ring her.
S1000609,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Not nice?
S1000611,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What exactly do you mean?
S1000613,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You’re attempting to run my life.
S1000615,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You’re developing distinctly possessive tendencies.
S1000617,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A possessive woman.
S1000619,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Can’t she?
S1000621,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Never heard of a possessive mum?
S1000623,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What?
S1000626,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I haven’t decided.
S1000628,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,They’re boys.
S1000630,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I don’t want to talk.
S1000632,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I haven’t got any.
S1000634,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Look, you’re speaking of a very good class bird."
S1000636,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I like being led. (Pause.) I need to be let out occasionally. Off the lead.
S1000638,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Shut it. (Pause.) Make me ill!
S1000640,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How dare you. Making filthy insinuations. I won’t have it. You disgust me you do. Standing there without your teeth. Why don’t you get smartened up? Get a new rig-out.
S1000642,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000644,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,And truly. You horrify me. (Pause.) You think I’m kidding. I’ll give up my room if you don’t watch out.
S1000646,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Clear out.
S1000649,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,A bit.
S1000651,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Mmmm.
S1000657,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(goes over to him) What you want?
S1000659,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Tell me what you want.
S1000661,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Let me know what you want and I’ll look for it.
S1000671,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(touches her hair) What?
S1000674,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What’s your news?
S1000676,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000684,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What have you bought me?
S1000686,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What? (Pause.) What?
S1000693,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Sure.
S1000695,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,We mustn’t let anyone know.
S1000705,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What for?
S1000707,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Who?
S1000709,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Who to?
S1000711,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What music?
S1000713,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,He mustn’t hear.
S1000715,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,He’d kill me. I’d be out of a job.
S1000717,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Don’t say anything. I’ll see a man I know.
S1000719,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Out of the question.
S1000721,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No. In any case I couldn’t marry you. I’m not the type. And all things being equal I may not be living here much longer.
S1000723,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000725,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What like?
S1000727,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I can’t do that.
S1000729,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It belonged to my mum.
S1000731,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000733,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,But it was left to me.
S1000735,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I do.
S1000737,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I hate parting with it.
S1000746,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I wasn’t cold.
S1000748,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000750,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Sometimes.
S1000756,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Check the oil?
S1000758,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Petrol?
S1000760,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Down?
S1000762,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Did we? Was it yesterday?
S1000764,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You ought to get yourself a new car. It eats petrol.
S1000766,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Me?
S1000768,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000776,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(moves) Sit by me.
S1000778,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000781,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m improving.
S1000783,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Can I rely on it?
S1000785,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Will it be expensive?
S1000787,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Thank you. Thank you.
S1000789,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I think I do.
S1000888,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1000891,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,What?
S1000893,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I don’t think you’d better.
S1000898,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Is she?
S1000900,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000902,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How old is she?
S1000904,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She’s …
S1000906,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She’s not bad.
S1000908,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I don’t think so.
S1000910,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I told you –
S1000912,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1000914,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I went for a spin. I had a headache.
S1000916,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Along the A40.
S1000918,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Nobody.
S1000920,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Three mates come with me.
S1000922,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I never asked.
S1000924,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"You’d recognize Harry Thorpe. Small, clear complexioned, infectious good humour."
S1000926,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Harry Beck I brought up one night. A Wednesday it was. But Dooloan no. You wouldn’t know him.
S1000928,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’d challenge that.
S1000930,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Impeccable taste. Buy their clothes up West.
S1000932,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Certainly not.
S1000934,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,(laughs) Oh … you jogged my memory … yes … Doolan’s married … an’ we took his wife along.
S1000936,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Straight up.
S1000938,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Would you accept an unconditional apology.
S1000940,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It won’t happen again.
S1000942,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I respect you.
S1000944,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Honest.
S1000946,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,That’s only your impression.
S1000948,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,This is the first time.
S1000950,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes. Can you believe me?
S1000952,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,In what way?
S1000954,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Mmmn …
S1000956,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Of course.
S1000958,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It might be.
S1000960,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Sure.
S1000962,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Well …?
S1000964,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’d be pleased.
S1000966,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You’re sensitive. You can’t be bothered.
S1000968,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No?
S1000970,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s a legitimate position.
S1000972,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m glad to hear it.
S1000974,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I feel … how would you say?
S1000976,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Occasionally. In a way.
S1000978,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,All the same it’s necessary.
S1000980,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’m with you there. All the way.
S1000982,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,On the main points we agree.
S1000984,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Now?
S1000986,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Will I get a rise in pay?
S1000988,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,My new situation calls for it.
S1000990,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,They were tokens. I’d like you to upgrade my salary. How about a little car?
S1000992,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,You could manage it.
S1000994,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,This year?
S1000996,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s a date.
S1000998,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Are you?
S1001000,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Something about me.
S1001002,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Really?
S1001004,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Yes.
S1001006,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Go on.
S1001008,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Your sister?
S1001010,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Sad, though."
S1001012,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1001014,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why shouldn’t you be?
S1001016,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It impresses me.
S1001018,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"What is it, Pop?"
S1001028,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"He can speak in front of me, can’t he, ED?"
S1001031,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I’d like to stay ED … in case …
S1001033,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Pop … (laughs) … EDwill tell me afterwards. See if he doesn’t.
S1001035,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Give in to him, eh, ED? (Laughs.) You know, Pop … well … (Pause.) O.K., have it your own way. (Exits.)"
S1001055,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(appears in the doorway) There’s a man outside wants a word with you, Pop. (Pause.) Urgent he says."
S1001057,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,How long?
S1001059,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s urgent.
S1001061,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"Grove. Or Greeves, I don’t know."
S1001063,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,He’s on about the … (Pause) … whether he can dump something. You’d better see him.
S1001075,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(enters carrying a suitcase. Puts it on the table. Opens it) Man en half creating, Pop. You ought to see to him. Jones or Greeves or whatever his name is. He’s out the back."
S1001081,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"(smiling) Oh, yes?"
S1001083,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,We have the odd confab sometimes. As I dawdle over my cocoa.
S1001086,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,About me?
S1001088,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Really?
S1001090,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Sometimes. He understands.
S1001092,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Who?
S1001094,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why?
S1001096,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,Why should I?
S1001098,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,She threw herself at me.
S1001100,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I put up a fight.
S1001102,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1001104,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1001106,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,No.
S1001108,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,It’s my upbringing. Lack of training. No proper parental control.

S1001164,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I thought you might be against me for that.
S1001166,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,I thought you might have an exaggerated respect for the elderly.
S1001168,P003,C0002,SLOANE,,"I’ve nothing against him. (Pause.) But he’s lived so long, he’s more like an old bird than a bloke. How is it such a father has such a son? A mystery. (Pause.) Certainly is. (EDpats his pockets.) Out of fags again, are you?"

A dead ringer for you as far as physique went. He was an expert on the adolescent male body. He’s completed an exhaustive study of his subject before I met him. During the course of one magical night he talked to me of his principles – offered me a job if I would accept them. Like a fool I turned him down. What an opportunity I lost, ED. If you were to make the same demands, I’d answer loudly in the affirmative."

S1000189,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Yes.
S1000191,P003,C0003,KEMP,,(pause) Come here.
S1000193,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I want to look at you.
S1000195,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I think we have met before.
S1000197,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You think that?
S1000199,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"(pause) Fetch me a plate, will you?"
S1000201,P003,C0003,KEMP,,The dresser. Back there.
S1000204,P003,C0003,KEMP,,We have met before! I knew we had.
S1000206,P003,C0003,KEMP,,On my life. I remember.
S1000208,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I could still identify you.
S1000210,P003,C0003,KEMP,,If it was necessary.
S1000212,P003,C0003,KEMP,,It might be.
S1000214,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Don’t speak to me like that, sonny. You’ll find yourself in trouble."
S1000216,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’ll have somebody to you. See if I don’t.
S1000219,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You provoked me!
S1000221,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"(goes to the door, shouting) KATH"
S1000223,P003,C0003,KEMP,,It wasn’t intentional. (Comes forward.)
S1000229,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I thought he was further off. I can’t judge distances.
S1000235,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"I never realized he was antagonistic to you, Mr SLOANE. Perhaps he’s jealous. We were getting on so well. (Pause.) Is it hurting you?"
S1000279,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What?
S1000283,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Yes. KATH
S1000285,P003,C0003,KEMP,,But he upset me.
S1000287,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’ve seen him before.
S1000289,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I didn’t throw them.
S1000291,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Where’s that?
S1000293,P003,C0003,KEMP,,A teetotal club on the corner is there?
S1000295,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I expect so.
S1000297,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What’s that?
S1000303,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’m not going to talk to him!
S1000305,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He knows I’m in always on Friday. (Pause.) I’m signing nothing you can tell him that.
S1000307,P003,C0003,KEMP,,That I’m not signing nothing.
S1000309,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’m not speaking to him.
S1000505,P003,C0003,KEMP,,(off) Is he gone?
S1000512,P003,C0003,KEMP,,No.
S1000514,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Never.
S1000516,P003,C0003,KEMP,,No.
S1000518,P003,C0003,KEMP,,No.
S1000520,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"I got lost, though."
S1000522,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I didn’t notice.
S1000524,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I haven’t been feeling well lately.
S1000526,P003,C0003,KEMP,,My eyes are getting much worse.
S1000528,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’m all alone.
S1000530,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He may take you away.
S1000532,P003,C0003,KEMP,,ED inburgh.
S1000534,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Or Bournemouth. You always said you’d go somewhere with palms.
S1000536,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You’d put me in a home. (Pause.) Would you be tempted?
S1000538,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You don’t love me.
S1000540,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"I’m going to die, KATH … I’m dying."
S1000542,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Goodnight then.
S1000654,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Seen my tablets?
S1000656,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I need one o’ my pills.
S1000658,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Let me alone.
S1000660,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I don’t want no help. (Pause.) I’m managing.
S1000662,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I can manage.
S1000664,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Coloured?
S1000666,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I expect he was. They do come over here. Raping people. It’s a problem. Just come out o’ jail had he?
S1000668,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Oh, they’re all for that."
S1000670,P003,C0003,KEMP,,All for that.
S1000673,P003,C0003,KEMP,,They should send them back.
S1000678,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You should’ve put in a complaint.
S1000680,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Playing his bloody music in the street.
S1000682,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What’s up?
S1000689,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What are you having?
S1000691,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Oh.
S1000697,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Are you having it after tea, KATH"
S1000699,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I thought of having one as well. Are you there?
S1000701,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Have you seen them pills?
S1000703,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Two.
S1001019,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Is EDthere with you? (Pause.) ED?
S1001021,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"No, no."
S1001023,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I want a word with you. (He squints in SLOANE

S1001027,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I got business to discuss.
S1001030,P003,C0003,KEMP,,It’s personal.
S1001032,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’m not talking in front of him.
S1001034,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I want to talk in private.
S1001036,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Is he gone?
S1001038,P003,C0003,KEMP,,That kid – who is he?
S1001040,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What’s his background?
S1001042,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You like him?
S1001044,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He comes to my room at night.
S1001046,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I can’t get to sleep. He talks all the time.
S1001048,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Goes on and on. (Pause.) An’ he makes things up about me. (He rolls up his sleeve, shows a bruise.) Give me a thumping, he did."
S1001050,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Before the weekend.
S1001052,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I can’t sleep for worry. He comes in and stands by my bed in the dark. In his pyjamas.
S1001054,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"(lifts his trouser leg, pulls down his sock, shows an Elastoplast) He kicked me yesterday."
S1001056,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Tell him to wait.
S1001058,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Tell him to wait will you?
S1001060,P003,C0003,KEMP,,What’s his name?
S1001062,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I don’t know nobody called that.
S1001064,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"(swings round, tries to bring SLOANE into focus) Oh …"
S1001067,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"He’s in bed with her most nights. People talk. The woman from the shop spotted it first. Four months gone, she reckons."
S1001069,P003,C0003,KEMP,,She’s like the side of a house lately. It’s not what she eats. (Silence.) Shall I tell you something else?
S1001071,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He’s got it in for me.
S1001073,P003,C0003,KEMP,,It’s because I’m a witness. To his crime.
S1001077,P003,C0003,KEMP,,There’s no man there.
S1001079,P003,C0003,KEMP,,It’s a blind. (Pause.) Let me tell you about the boy.
S1001183,P003,C0003,KEMP,,(off) What’s that?
S1001186,P003,C0003,KEMP,,ED? (Pause.) Where’s ED?
S1001188,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Nothing, sonnie."
S1001190,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I – (Pause.) Business.
S1001192,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He’s her brother. He ought to know.
S1001194,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Got to know sometime.
S1001196,P003,C0003,KEMP,,No.
S1001198,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Yes.
S1001200,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You’re a criminal.
S1001202,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I know you are. You killed my old boss. I know it was you.
S1001204,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I got to go. (Pause.) I’m expecting delivery of a damson tree.
S1001206,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I don’t have to. They got fingerprints.
S1001208,P003,C0003,KEMP,,All over the shop.
S1001210,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Oh … I know …
S1001212,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You murdered him.
S1001214,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"No, sonnie … no."
S1001216,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You’re bad.
S1001218,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Get away from me. Let me alone.
S1001220,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He was healthy. Sound as a bell.
S1001222,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He won cups for it. Looked after himself.
S1001224,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"Weak heart, my arse. You murdered him."
S1001226,P003,C0003,KEMP,,He was hit from behind.
S1001228,P003,C0003,KEMP,,The equipment.
S1001230,P003,C0003,KEMP,,You meant to.
S1001232,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Liar … lying little bugger. I knew what you was from the start.
S1001234,P003,C0003,KEMP,,"No … you’re finished. (Attempts to rise. SLOANE pushes him back. KEMP raises his stick, SLOANE takes it from him.)"
S1001236,P003,C0003,KEMP,,EDwill be back soon. (Rises to go.)
S1001238,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’m seeing him then.
S1001240,P003,C0003,KEMP,,No.
S1001242,P003,C0003,KEMP,,Ugh! aaah …
S1001244,P003,C0003,KEMP,,I’ll see the police.

S1004168,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Oh, here you are."
S1004170,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yesterday.
S1004172,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s it like out?
S1004174,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Isn’t it raining?
S1004176,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I shall be there soon enough.
S1004177,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t know.
S1004179,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’d rather have a smoke of my pipe.
S1004181,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m going anyway.
S1004183,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Like a funeral.
S1004185,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nothing much to be cheerful about.
S1004187,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They daren’t give me any.
S1004189,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004191,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Sister’s looking.
S1004222,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s noisy in here.
S1004224,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Ear-plugs?
S1004226,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"I had to have an injection last night, to make me sleep."
S1004228,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004230,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I felt the same.
S1004232,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They had to give me oxygen.
S1004234,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Yes, I could scarcely breathe."
S1004236,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004238,P004,C0021,KEMP,,About the same.
S1004240,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It gets worse every night.
S1004242,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They had a screen around me.
S1004244,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They had the green light on!
S1004246,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Green for go. Yes, they know when you’re going to die."
S1004248,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They’ll have to carry me out!
S1004250,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I shall be here until they carry me out.
S1004252,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I won’t bother you much longer.
S1004254,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t want to.
S1004256,P004,C0021,KEMP,,But I’m going to.
S1004258,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I shan’t see spring.
S1004260,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I shan’t see them.
S1004262,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’ve lost the use of it.
S1004264,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t want one.
S1004266,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I do feel a bit low today.
S1004268,P004,C0021,KEMP,,(shouting) It’s noisy in here.
S1004297,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I wish I’d gone.
S1004308,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nothing much to be cheerful about. I’m losing weight – I’m as thin as a lath.
S1004383,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004385,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I hope she’s behaving herself.
S1004387,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Who?
S1004389,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Ah.
S1004391,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Did she.
S1004393,P004,C0021,KEMP,,All that fog down by the cemetery.
S1004395,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No. She’s been a good friend to me.
S1004397,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Say goodbye to her for me.
S1004399,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m sinking.
S1004401,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"No, I shan’t be here much longer."
S1004403,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004405,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Ask her.
S1004407,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Go on, she won’t mind."
S1004412,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t mind.
S1004414,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s all the same to me.
S1004418,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004427,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004432,P004,C0021,KEMP,,If you want.
S1004434,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’ll have that one.
S1004448,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Ah.
S1004450,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004454,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m tired.
S1004456,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m dying!
S1004458,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004460,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004463,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004465,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nurse …
S1004468,P004,C0021,KEMP,,How old are you?
S1004470,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"If I live to July, I’ll be eighty-five."
S1004474,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"You can’t imagine what it’s like to be old, nurse. Look at that hand. (Close-up of hand.) It’s not a hand at all."
S1004476,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s more like a claw!
S1004478,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Everything passes. I shan’t see another summer.
S1004481,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m dying –
S1004547,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They said you were dead.
S1004549,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They said you were dead.
S1004551,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"No, DEAD! They said you’d passed out."
S1004553,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’s taken a fancy to you.
S1004555,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’s taken a fancy to you. You’d better watch out.
S1004557,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You want to watch out. (Pause.) They said you were dead. I saw them flying about. I asked one of them what was the matter.
S1004559,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I was surprised. Very surprised.
S1004561,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"I don’t know. I was, that’s all. You didn’t look as though you were going to pass out."
S1004563,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"You looked a bit under the weather, but not on your last legs. No."
S1004565,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"You looked it. Yes. (Pause.) It would have been a shock if you’d gone. I mean, you don’t expect that sort of thing to happen – not in front of your face. I must say, they all took it very well considering. I admired that nurse – the way she kept her head. (Taking out his pipe and filling it.)"
S1004567,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes. I think they want to kill me.
S1004569,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They want to do me in.
S1004571,P004,C0021,KEMP,,(darkly) Is it?
S1004573,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’ve got no confidence in them. None at all. I wonder sometimes if we’re safe in the hands of these nurses. Look at old Wilkins – talking about getting up on Friday. (Pause.) Saturday he was dead.
S1004575,P004,C0021,KEMP,,So they say.
S1004577,P004,C0021,KEMP,,He’d had a few words with the Sister on Friday. On Saturday he was dead. You can’t put it plainer than that.
S1004579,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Anything on?
S1004581,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I like a nice play. I must have missed it.
S1004583,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You ought to have wakened me. You’ve let me miss some nice things. Many a time I wake up and you tell me about something good that’s been on. (Pause.) I’m sorry I missed it.
S1004585,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Ah, she’s one of the highbrows. Likes classical music."
S1004587,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Ah well, it’s the way these people manage their lives. Live and let live, I say. (Pause.) What are you listening to?"
S1004589,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What kind of music?
S1004591,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You ought to ask her to switch over.
S1004593,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Good play on yesterday, was there, then?"
S1004595,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What time would that be?
S1004597,P004,C0021,KEMP,,My daughter was thinking about taking up Opera one time. All for it she was.
S1004599,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Eldest living.
S1004601,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004603,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nine.
S1004605,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Not all of them lived.
S1004607,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes. Conditions have changed.
S1004609,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"It’s all changed now. It’s different. I think the first we had was a boy. He died of what they call meningitis. Then we had twins. I believe they came next. Anne and Winifred. They lived until they were twelve. Then we lost them within a week of each other. I can’t remember the cause. (Pause.) I knew at the time, of course. I asked the doctor straight out what had happened. He told me."
S1004611,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I can’t recall what he said now. It’s a long time ago. Before you were born.
S1004613,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Ah yes. We did think of having her trained.
S1004615,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes. We took her along to that Madame Valerini. You’ve heard of her?
S1004617,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"She was very well-known at the time. She had a voice that could break wine-glasses. That’s what they said. I often wondered if it was true. I would have asked her, but I didn‘t like to. Not that she would have minded. She wasn’t that type. But it seemed too personal, so I didn’t."
S1004619,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"I remember we took a cab from the corner to Madame’s studio. Just before the Great War, it was. Only cost us a shilling. Not much, is it?"
S1004621,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"It’s not much. Well, it wasn’t far. We could have walked, but we thought Madame might not like us to. It wasn’t done in those days. In those days it wasn’t done to arrive at anyone’s door on foot. It was more than your life was worth. It’s gone out now. Nobody bothers."
S1004623,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It was. It laid a heavy burden on the Working Classes. I always maintain it was done on purpose. You’ll never persuade me different. It was deliberate policy.
S1004625,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"You came too late. You’ve no conception. The ruling classes of those days, they made some impossible rules. Impossible. They couldn’t keep up with half of them themselves. And they used to drink a lot. Drink rots the brain, you know."
S1004627,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You could tell when you saw them.
S1004629,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Very different.
S1004631,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Madame put us into a waiting-room when we arrived. She seemed a bit cross about something. I expect one of her students had upset her. Very irritating they can be, these students. ‘What can I do for you?’ she said. So I told her. told her Daisy had set her heart on singing. She listened to every word I said – she was a good listener."
S1004633,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s that?
S1004635,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"She took Daisy into the next room. We could hear them. No getting away from it, Daisy had done better. That day she didn’t have a fair chance. All the same Madame seemed very pleased with her. ‘You have a very nice voice,’ she said. Just like that."
S1004637,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Nothing. It was just before the Great War, you see, and Madame had a lot on her plate. With her concerts, her students, her private tuition, she hadn’t the time. So we had to let it go. We let it go at that. Daisy seemed to lose interest. I’d warned her, ‘You’ve got the rest of your life in front of you.’ She didn’t see it that way, though. She moped."
S1004639,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nothing usual. Only for kids.
S1004641,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nice. Very nice.
S1004643,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Weren’t you sure?
S1004645,P004,C0021,KEMP,,White dresses?
S1004647,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I like a little girl in a white dress. Were they going to a party?
S1004649,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Was it Christmas?
S1004651,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Somebody’s birthday? What were they celebrating?
S1004653,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What was it about?
S1004655,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"In the army, was he? I wish I’d heard it."
S1004657,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You gathered that?
S1004659,P004,C0021,KEMP,,This Major?
S1004661,P004,C0021,KEMP,,He must have been unbalanced. (Pause.) Did they give a reason?
S1004663,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No sane man would do a thing like that. How did they get out?
S1004665,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Of the cupboard?
S1004667,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Oh. Did it hold your interest?
S1004669,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I wish I’d heard it. I’m sorry I missed it. Sounds interesting.
S1004671,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004695,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Yes, thank you."
S1004697,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004698,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Not yet.
S1004700,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t usually so early. I thought I’d just wait and see.
S1004705,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004712,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It was quite comfy before.
S1004714,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Thank you.
S1004722,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"When I was in Mary Ward, my daughter brought in something of the sort. The sister found them. Took them away, she did. ‘Don’t let me catch you with those,’ she said. ‘Never!’ It seems they were bad for the inside."
S1004724,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004726,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What shaving soap do you use?
S1004728,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"I use Coal Tar. I always have – I find it refreshing. I can’t stick that brushless. I tried some once. It brought up a rash. I forget its name. Very bad I was. (Pause.) When I shaved first, they didn’t use soap. I was still at school."
S1004730,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Vastly. When I walked down the road, I could hardly lift my feet. Very heavy, the boots was in those days. (Pause.) Many children had nothing to put on their feet at all. I was seven when I went to school. Thrash, thrash, thrash! I can see the master now, pulling a lad across his desk. (Pause.) That memory has stayed with me vividly. (Indicating earphones.) What’s on?"
S1004732,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nothing?
S1004741,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes. This is Mr BASSET.
S1004743,P004,C0021,KEMP,,All right.
S1004745,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004747,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004749,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Did you?
S1004751,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"A war veteran, is he? Did you get his name?"
S1004753,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Might have been.
S1004755,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Although I never knew anybody who played the accordion.
S1004757,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I never did.
S1004759,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t blame him.
S1004761,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Didn’t I tell you?
S1004763,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It was not on the Somme.
S1004765,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Not on the Somme.
S1004767,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’ve not forgotten.
S1004769,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It was never the same again. No. Never. I might have been killed. And what was it all for? They’re names now – all names
S1004771,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They gave me a medal. I lost it when we were bombed out last time. I ask you – what kind of people are they? They give you a medal in one war and blow it to bits in the next. I wrote them a letter. They never replied. I might as well never have bothered.
S1004774,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"What did I get wounded for? People die, don’t they? They die. All this talking, but people die. (Pause.) My lungs have never been the same. I’ve had pain."
S1004777,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"They forget. Talk, talk, talk. Men die, and they talk. They lay wreaths, they have services, they sell poppies. What a waste it’s all been, what a waste."
S1004782,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t think it’s worth it. I don’t think it’s worth a single death.
S1004788,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That’s why he’s here.
S1004875,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004877,P004,C0021,KEMP,,After breakfast.
S1004879,P004,C0021,KEMP,,In the ward.
S1004898,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"He does smell, you know."
S1004900,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Nerves. He had a breakdown – went berserk. Hit their foreman.
S1004902,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Working away there he was. He’d done it for years. Then all of a sudden he clouts the foreman.
S1004904,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Apparently not.
S1004906,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What is it?
S1004908,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’s getting a big girl.
S1004910,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s this in the background?
S1004912,P004,C0021,KEMP,,The horse?
S1004914,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Where does Madge get the money from?
S1004916,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Go on.
S1004918,P004,C0021,KEMP,,As long as she doesn’t bring her out too far.
S1004920,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Who’s that holding the horse?
S1004922,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That’s a nice dog there.
S1004924,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I think it is.
S1004926,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That’ll be the size of it.
S1004928,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Janice is keen on it though?
S1004930,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Madge hasn’t been in to see me.
S1004932,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"No, she doesn’t care. Never did."
S1004934,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1004936,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I suppose not.
S1004938,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Will you be coming tomorrow?
S1004940,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Some oranges.
S1004942,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’d appreciate an orange. Or a nice soft pear.
S1004944,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Have they?
S1004946,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That’s nice.
S1004948,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I don’t feel so bad today.
S1004950,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Ta, ta. Mind how you cross that road."
S1004953,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004955,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Thank you.
S1004957,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"No, thanks. (Pause.) She’s coming again tomorrow."
S1004958,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004960,P004,C0021,KEMP,,A fair way.
S1004962,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s the same everywhere. (Pause.) I expect it’ll be better when summer comes.
S1004964,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Don’t say that!
S1004966,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s not right.
S1004968,P004,C0021,KEMP,,They ought to do something about it.
S1004970,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What?
S1004972,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Bang, bang, bang. You can’t get away from it. They’ve no consideration."
S1004974,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’ll have to be getting a move on to get home before the rush.
S1004976,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1004978,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s the matter?
S1004980,P004,C0021,KEMP,,To catch her bus. That’s to catch her bus.
S1004982,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Only one living. Yes.
S1004983,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s happened?
S1004984,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Someone’s been knocked over!
S1004986,P004,C0021,KEMP,,(climbing up on his bed) It’s my daughter!
S1004987,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Here you are then.
S1004989,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Yes, I was feeling much better. It’s warm out. Just like spring. How are you?"
S1004991,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I was worried about you yesterday. I can tell you. Worried.
S1004993,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Madge came in to see me. I told her what a fright you’d given me.
S1004995,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She wasn’t allowed.
S1004996,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What does she say?
S1004998,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Oh.
S1005000,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What’s the matter with Molly?
S1005002,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You have.
S1005004,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Is that so?
S1005005,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’s got no control over Molly.
S1005007,P004,C0021,KEMP,,She’s not got a bit. Does just what she likes. Absolutely.
S1005009,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I put the blame on her parents. She should have been taught.
S1005011,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’s wrong. They ought to face up to responsibilities.
S1005013,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Too late.
S1005015,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I suppose Mrs Flackwell will be going round with a face as long as a fiddle?
S1005017,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Not Molly.
S1005019,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It would break Evie’s heart.
S1005021,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It’d finish her!
S1005023,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Well, there isn’t."
S1005025,P004,C0021,KEMP,,So you put your mind at rest.
S1005027,P004,C0021,KEMP,,(wriggling) I don’t think this chair is as comfortable as the other one.
S1005029,P004,C0021,KEMP,,The one by my bed.
S1005031,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That one’s more springy.
S1005033,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"No, this one isn’t so comfy. There’s not enough give in it. That one across by the window looks nice."
S1005035,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1005037,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Do you think I could change them?
S1005039,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"If I changed them, the Sister would never notice."
S1005041,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Would she be cross? What? I wouldn’t like to be caught in the act.
S1005043,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I’m not. I’m only easing my position. Are they grapes you’ve got there?
S1005045,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You can eat a grape any time. (Takes several.)
S1005047,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I must sit on the bed. (Doing so.) That chair is making me feel ill.
S1005049,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It isn’t. (Pause.) Old Wilkins went at the weekend – did I tell you?
S1005051,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Yes.
S1005053,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1005055,P004,C0021,KEMP,,His family will be feeling a bit low.
S1005057,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.
S1005059,P004,C0021,KEMP,,These young girls can’t wait.
S1005061,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I blame the parents.
S1005063,P004,C0021,KEMP,,That’s no bad thing.
S1005066,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Don’t sit on the bed?
S1005068,P004,C0021,KEMP,,"Oh, very well."
S1005071,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I sit on the bed in the other ward.
S1005073,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No one said anything about it in there.
S1005075,P004,C0021,KEMP,,No.

S1005137,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What is it?
S1005139,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I wish you wouldn’t.
S1005302,P004,C0021,KEMP,,What did you say?
S1005304,P004,C0021,KEMP,,I feel tired.
S1005306,P004,C0021,KEMP,,Go where?
S1005307,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You mean die?
S1005309,P004,C0021,KEMP,,You’re in a funny mood. I came in here to cheer you up.
S1005311,P004,C0021,KEMP,,It frightens me when you talk like that.
S1005313,P004,C0021,KEMP,,(nodding off) Very nice.
S1000299,P003,C0004,ED,,(outside the window) I rung the bell but you was out.
S1000301,P003,C0004,ED,,I’ll be round. (Closes the window.)
S1000308,P003,C0004,ED,,(entering) Is he still on? What’s the matter with you?
S1000310,P003,C0004,ED,,"(patiently) Go on, get out of it afore I kicks you out. Make me bad you do. With your silly, childish ways."
S1000312,P003,C0004,ED,,(watches her. Takes a drag of his cigarette) What’s this I heard about you?
S1000314,P003,C0004,ED,,Listening are you?
S1000316,P003,C0004,ED,,You’ve got a kid staying here.
S1000318,P003,C0004,ED,,Don’t lie to me.
S1000320,P003,C0004,ED,,Who told you to take in lodgers?
S1000322,P003,C0004,ED,,I’ll give you the money.
S1000324,P003,C0004,ED,,I don’t want men hanging around.
S1000326,P003,C0004,ED,,You know what these fellows are – young men with no fixed abode.
S1000328,P003,C0004,ED,,You know what they say about landladies?
S1000330,P003,C0004,ED,,"They say they’d sleep with a broom handle in trousers, that’s what they say."
S1000332,P003,C0004,ED,,You’re good-natured though. They mistake it.
S1000334,P003,C0004,ED,,"You’ve got to realize my position. I can’t have my sister keeping a common kip. Some of my associates are men of distinction. They think nothing of tipping a fiver. That sort of person. If they realized how my family carry on I’d be banned from the best places. (Pause.) And another thing … you don’t want them talking about you. An’ I can’t guarantee my influence will keep them quiet. Nosy neighbours and scandal. Oh, my word, the looks you’ll get. (Pause.) How old is he?"
S1000336,P003,C0004,ED,,These fellows sleep with their landladies automatic. Has he made suggestions? Suggested you bring him supper in bed?
S1000338,P003,C0004,ED,,That’s what they do. Then they take advantage.
S1000340,P003,C0004,ED,,Where did you find him?
S1000342,P003,C0004,ED,,"Picked him up, did you?"

S1000347,P003,C0004,ED,,"Had the trousers off him already I see. (Balls his fist and punches her upper arm gently.) Don’t let me down, darlin’. (Pause.) Where is he?"
S1000349,P003,C0004,ED,,You fetch him.
S1000351,P003,C0004,ED,,I want to see him.

S1000356,P003,C0004,ED,,(calls after her) Tell him to put his trousers on. (Picks up the trousers and flings them after her.) Cantering around the house with a bare bum. Good job I come when I did. (Pause.) Can’t leave you alone for five minutes.
S1000358,P003,C0004,ED,,It’d crease me if you misbehaved again. I got responsibilities.

S1000376,P003,C0004,ED,,"Sounds as though it was a happy atmosphere. (Pause.) Got anything to do, KATH"
S1000378,P003,C0004,ED,,No beds to make?
S1000380,P003,C0004,ED,,Maybe you forgot to change the pillowslips?
S1000382,P003,C0004,ED,,I must apologize for her behaviour. She’s not in the best of health.
S1000384,P003,C0004,ED,,"You can’t always go on appearances. She’s… well I wouldn’t say unbalanced. No, that’d be going too far. She suffers from migraine. That’s why it’d be best if you declined her offer of a room."
S1000386,P003,C0004,ED,,When are you going?
S1000388,P003,C0004,ED,,I dare say you do. The fact is my sister’s taking on too many responsibilities. She’s a charming woman as a rule. Charming. I’ve no hesitation in saying that. Lost her husband. And her little kid. Tell you did she?
S1000390,P003,C0004,ED,,(wary) What did she say?
S1000392,P003,C0004,ED,,She married a mate of mine – a valiant man – we were together in Africa.
S1000394,P003,C0004,ED,,"You’re interested in the army, eh? Soldiers, garrison towns, etc. Does that interest you?"
S1000396,P003,C0004,ED,,"Good, excellent. How old are you?"
S1000398,P003,C0004,ED,,Married?

S1000402,P003,C0004,ED,,No. You’re a librarian?
S1000404,P003,C0004,ED,,I thought she said –
S1000406,P003,C0004,ED,,I was told you were.
S1000408,P003,C0004,ED,,"I see. I’ve been mistaken. (Silence.) Well, as I just said … I don’t think it’d suit you. What with one thing and another. (Pause.) To show there’s no hard feelings I’ll make it worth your while. Call it a gift."
S1000410,P003,C0004,ED,,Not at all. (Pause.) I’d like to give you a little present. Anything you care to name. Within reason.
S1000412,P003,C0004,ED,,(laughs) Well … no … Jags. (Laughs.)… no sports cars. I’m not going as far as that.

(Stubs out his cigarrette into a glass seashell on the sideboard.) Are you a sports fan? Eh? Fond of sport? You look as though you might be. Look the … outdoor type, I’d say."
S1000416,P003,C0004,ED,,"I’d say you were. That’s what struck me when you walked in. That’s what puzzled me. She gave me the impression you were … well, don’t be offended … I had the notion you were a shop assistant."
S1000418,P003,C0004,ED,,No. (Pause.) I see you’re not that type. You’re more of a … as you might say … the fresh air type.
S1000420,P003,C0004,ED,,You’re fond of swimming?
S1000422,P003,C0004,ED,,Bodybuilding?
S1000424,P003,C0004,ED,,"I used to do a lot of that at one time. With my mate … we used to do all what you’ve just said. (Pause.) We were young. Innocent too. (Shrugs. Pats his pocket. Takes out a packet of cigarettes. Smokes.) All over now. (Pause.) Developing your muscles, eh? And character. (Pause.) … Well, well, well. (Breathless.) A little bodybuilder are you? I bet you are … (Slowly.)… do you … (Shy.) exercise regular?"
S1000426,P003,C0004,ED,,"Good, good. Stripped?"
S1000428,P003,C0004,ED,,Complete. (Striding to the window.) How invigorating.
S1000430,P003,C0004,ED,,Ever done any wrestling?

S1000436,P003,C0004,ED,,(laughs) Get away! (Pause.) The question is are you clean living? You may as well know I set great store by morals. Too much of this casual bunking up nowadays. Too many lads being ruined by birds. I don’t want you messing about with my sister.
S1000438,P003,C0004,ED,,Have you made overtures to her?
S1000440,P003,C0004,ED,,Would you?
S1000442,P003,C0004,ED,,Not if circumstances were ripe?
S1000444,P003,C0004,ED,,Does she disgust you?
S1000446,P003,C0004,ED,,It would be better if she did.
S1000448,P003,C0004,ED,,"I’ve a certain amount of influence. Friends with money. I’ve two cars. Judge for yourself. I generally spend my holidays in places where the bints have got rings through their noses. (Pause.) Women are like banks, boy, breaking and entering is a serious business. Give me your word you’re not vaginalatrous?"
S1000450,P003,C0004,ED,,(pause) I’ll believe you. Can you drive?
S1000452,P003,C0004,ED,,I might let you be my chauffeur.

S1000458,P003,C0004,ED,,You’ll find me a nice employer. (Pause.) When you come to see me we must have a drink. A talk.

S1000462,P003,C0004,ED,,Do you drink?
S1000464,P003,C0004,ED,,"You aren’t in training at the moment, are you?"
S1000466,P003,C0004,ED,,I wouldn’t want you to break your training. Drinking I don’t mind. Drugs I abhor. You’ll get to know all my habits.
S1000468,P003,C0004,ED,,A word with you afore I go.
S1000470,P003,C0004,ED,,‘Course he’s staying.

S1000476,P003,C0004,ED,,You picked a nice lad there. Very nice. Clean. No doubt upright. A sports enthusiast. All the proper requisites. Don’t take any money from him. I’ll pay.
S1000478,P003,C0004,ED,,What do you want to do that for?
S1000480,P003,C0004,ED,,He can buy his own clothes. Making yourself look ridiculous.
S1000482,P003,C0004,ED,,No.
S1000484,P003,C0004,ED,,Why?
S1000486,P003,C0004,ED,,If you want. (Pause.) He’ll laugh at you.
S1000488,P003,C0004,ED,,I must go. I’ll have a light meal. Take a couple of nembutal and then bed. I shall be out of town tomorrow.
S1000490,P003,C0004,ED,,In Aylesbury. I shall dress in a quiet suit. Drive up in the motor. The Commissionaire will spring forward. There in that miracle of glass and concrete my colleagues and me will have a quiet drink before the business of the day.
S1000492,P003,C0004,ED,,Mature men.
S1000494,P003,C0004,ED,,What are you talking about? I live in a world of top decisions. We’ve no time for ladies.

S1000507,P003,C0004,ED,,(petulant) Isn’t it incredible? I’m his only son. He won’t see me. (Goes to the door. Speaks through.) I want a word with you. (Pause.) Is he without human feelings? (Pause. Brokenly.) He won’t speak to me. Has he no heart?
S1000509,P003,C0004,ED,,I’ll get my lawyer to send a letter. If it’s done legal he’ll prove amenable. Give us a kiss. (Kisses her. Pats her bottom.) Be a good girl now. (Exit.)

S1000741,P003,C0004,ED,,They just delivered it.
S1000743,P003,C0004,ED,,"Damaged, was he?"
S1000745,P003,C0004,ED,,"Well, well. (Pause.) It’s monkey weather out there."
S1000747,P003,C0004,ED,,"You’re young. Healthy. Don’t feel the cold, do you?"
S1000749,P003,C0004,ED,,Not at all?

S1000755,P003,C0004,ED,,"He doesn’t want to feel my hand. (Pause.) When you’re ready, boy, we’ll go."

S1000759,P003,C0004,ED,,"Mmn. (Pause.) Down, en it?"
S1000761,P003,C0004,ED,,From yesterday. We filled her up yesterday.
S1000763,P003,C0004,ED,,Mmn. (Pause.) We used a lot since then.
S1000765,P003,C0004,ED,,"Maybe you’re right. You didn’t use it last night, did you?"
S1000767,P003,C0004,ED,,I thought you might have.
S1000769,P003,C0004,ED,,Funny.
S1000771,P003,C0004,ED,,What do you want to do that for?
S1000773,P003,C0004,ED,,Chucking money about.

S1000777,P003,C0004,ED,,(sits next to him) You didn’t use my motor last night then?
S1000779,P003,C0004,ED,,"That’s all I wanted. As long as you’re telling the truth, boy."
S1000782,P003,C0004,ED,,"Yes, I can tell that. You’ve grown bolder since we met. Bigger and bolder. Don’t get too bold will you? Eh? (Laughs.) I’m going to buy you something for your birthday as well."
S1000784,P003,C0004,ED,,Aah.
S1000786,P003,C0004,ED,,"Very. I might consider lashing out a bit and buying you a … um, er, aahhh …"
S1000788,P003,C0004,ED,,Don’t thank me. Thank yourself. You deserve it.
S1000790,P003,C0004,ED,,I think you do. Go and put that box in the kitchen.

S1000795,P003,C0004,ED,,Where was he last night?
S1000797,P003,C0004,ED,,What else?
S1000799,P003,C0004,ED,,He used the car last night.
S1000801,P003,C0004,ED,,If he’s not careful he can have his cards.
S1000803,P003,C0004,ED,,Joy-riding in my motor.
S1000805,P003,C0004,ED,,Act your age. (Pause.) Encouraging him. I’ve watched you. What you want to keep him in here for all morning?

S1000815,P003,C0004,ED,,(glances at her) Keeping him in when he ought to be at work. How do you expect him to work well with you messing about?
S1000817,P003,C0004,ED,,Taking him from his duty. Wasting my money.
S1000819,P003,C0004,ED,,It’s too late. I’ll pay him off. Not satisfactory.
S1000821,P003,C0004,ED,,Not the type of person that I had expected.
S1000823,P003,C0004,ED,,He can go elsewhere.

S1000835,P003,C0004,ED,,You were wicked then.
S1000837,P003,C0004,ED,,"Being rude. Ruining my little matie. Teaching him nasty things. That’s why I sent it away. (Pause.) You’re not doing rude things with this kiddy, are you, like you did with Tommy?"
S1000839,P003,C0004,ED,,Sure?
S1000841,P003,C0004,ED,,I can’t trust you.

S1000861,P003,C0004,ED,,"(laughs) Well, well. Fancy you remembering. You must have a long memory."
S1000863,P003,C0004,ED,,Let me disillusion you.
S1000865,P003,C0004,ED,,"You need hurting, you do. Mr and Mrs Albion Bolter were quite ready to have you marry Tommy."
S1000867,P003,C0004,ED,,Allow me to know.
S1000869,P003,C0004,ED,,I’m not.
S1000871,P003,C0004,ED,,You could have been educated. Gone to beauty salons. Learned to speak well.
S1000873,P003,C0004,ED,,They wanted you to marry him. Tommy and me had our first set-to about it. You should have heard the language he used to me.
S1000875,P003,C0004,ED,,Forget it.
S1000877,P003,C0004,ED,,I burned it.
S1000879,P003,C0004,ED,,And that kiddy out there. I’m not having him go the same way.
S1000881,P003,C0004,ED,,Yes. (Pause.) And that old photo as well. I thought you was taking an unhealthy interest in the past.
S1000883,P003,C0004,ED,,You forget it.

S1000897,P003,C0004,ED,,No! (Sharply.) Haven’t you got anything to do? Standing there all day.
S1000899,P003,C0004,ED,,Not noticed?
S1000901,P003,C0004,ED,,I have.
S1000903,P003,C0004,ED,,Forty-one. (Shrugs.) Forty-two. She ought to slim. I’d advise that.

S1000909,P003,C0004,ED,,Where was you last night?
S1000911,P003,C0004,ED,,I know what you told me. A pack of lies. D’you think I’m an idiot or something?

S1000921,P003,C0004,ED,,They had headaches too?
S1000923,P003,C0004,ED,,Cheeky. (Pause.) Who are they? Would I want them in my motor?
S1000925,P003,C0004,ED,,I might.
S1000927,P003,C0004,ED,,"Riding round in my motor all night, eh?"
S1000929,P003,C0004,ED,,What type of youth are they?
S1000931,P003,C0004,ED,,Any of them wear lipstick?
S1000933,P003,C0004,ED,,"You’d notice, would you? (Throws over a lipstick.) What’s this doing in the back of the motor?"
S1000935,P003,C0004,ED,,Can’t you do better than that?
S1000937,P003,C0004,ED,,"(emotionally) Oh, boy … Taking birds out in my motor."
S1000939,P003,C0004,ED,,Telling me lies.
S1000941,P003,C0004,ED,,What are your feelings towards me?
S1000943,P003,C0004,ED,,Is that the truth?
S1000945,P003,C0004,ED,,Then why tell me lies?
S1000947,P003,C0004,ED,,Was this an isolated incident?
S1000949,P003,C0004,ED,,Really.
S1000951,P003,C0004,ED,,I believe you. I believe you’re regretting the incident already. But don’t repeat it. (Silence.) Or next time I won’t be so lenient. (Pause.) I think the time has come for us to make a change.
S1000953,P003,C0004,ED,,I need you on tap.
S1000955,P003,C0004,ED,,At all hours. In case I have to make a journey to a distant place at an unexpected and inconvenient hour of the night. In a manner of speaking it’s urgent.
S1000957,P003,C0004,ED,,I got work to do. (Pause.) I think it would be best if you leave here today.
S1000959,P003,C0004,ED,,Give it a trial. (Pause.) You see my way of looking at it?
S1000961,P003,C0004,ED,,"And you shouldn’t be left with her. She’s no good. No good at all. A crafty tart she is. I could tell you things about – the way these women carry on. (Pause.) Especially her. (Opens window. Throws cigarette out.) These women do you no good. I can tell you that. (Feels in his coat pocket. Takes out a packet of mints. Puts one in his mouth. Pause.) One of sixteen come up to me the other day – which is a thing I never expected, come up to me and said she’d been given my address. I don’t know whether it was a joke or something. You see that sort of thing …"
S1000963,P003,C0004,ED,,You could check it.
S1000965,P003,C0004,ED,,Certainly. I got feelings.
S1000967,P003,C0004,ED,,You got it wrong when you says that. I seen birds all shapes and sizes and I’m most certainly not … um … ah … sensitive.
S1000969,P003,C0004,ED,,I just don’t give a monkey’s fart.
S1000971,P003,C0004,ED,,But I can deal with them same as you.
S1000973,P003,C0004,ED,,What’s your opinion of the way these women carry on?
S1000975,P003,C0004,ED,,Don’t you think they’re crude?
S1000977,P003,C0004,ED,,You never know where you are with half of them.
S1000979,P003,C0004,ED,,"Ah well, you’re talking of a different subject entirely. It’s necessary. Occasionally. But it’s got to be kept within bounds."
S1000981,P003,C0004,ED,,"(laughs) I’ve seen funny things happen and no mistake. The way these birds treat decent fellows. I hope you never get serious with one. What a life. Backache, headache or her mum told her never to when there’s an ‘R’ in the month. (Pause. Stares from window.) How do you feel then?"
S1000983,P003,C0004,ED,,Pack your bags.
S1000985,P003,C0004,ED,,Immediate.
S1000987,P003,C0004,ED,,A rise?

S1000991,P003,C0004,ED,,That’s a bit (laughs) of an unusual request en it?
S1000993,P003,C0004,ED,,It all costs money. I tell you what – I’ll promise you one for Christmas.
S1000995,P003,C0004,ED,,Or next year.

S1000999,P003,C0004,ED,,I see you had possibilities from the start. You had an air. (Pause.) A way with you.
S1001001,P003,C0004,ED,,That’s it. The perfect phrase. Personality.
S1001003,P003,C0004,ED,,That’s why I don’t want you living here. Wicked waste. I’m going to tell you something. Prepare to raise your eyebrows.

S1001681,P003,C0004,ED,,"It’s what is called a dilemma, boy. You are on the horns of it."

S1001695,P003,C0004,ED,,"Expensive equipment gone west now see? I’m annoyed with you, boy. Seriously annoyed. Giving us the benefit of your pauperism. Is this what we listen to the Week’s Good Cause for? A lot of vicars and actresses making appeals for cash gifts to raise hooligans who can’t control themselves? I’d’ve given my cheque to the anti-Jewish League if I’d known."
S1001697,P003,C0004,ED,,Coming in here as a lodger. Raised in a charity home. The lack of common courtesy in some people is appalling.

S1001725,P003,C0004,ED,,"Yes, he’s definitely attractive in adversity. Really, boy, what with one thing and another … I warned you against women, didn’t I? They land you in impossible predicaments of this nature."
S1001727,P003,C0004,ED,,"You believe that, do you? I hope so. Marriage is a non-starter, then?"
S1001729,P003,C0004,ED,,Are you repentant now? Truly ashamed of yourself?
S1001731,P003,C0004,ED,,"You aren’t going to press your claims are you? Even if he thee worshipped with his body, his mind would be elsewhere. And a wife cannot testify against her husband."

S1001735,P003,C0004,ED,,"Fine. (Pause.) I think, boy, you’d better go and wait in the car. Keep the engine running. I won’t be long. I want a private talk with my sister."
S1001737,P003,C0004,ED,,Well … perhaps.
S1001739,P003,C0004,ED,,Will you?
S1001741,P003,C0004,ED,,"Not eternally, boy. Just a few years (He pats SLOANE on the shoulder. SLOANE exits.) What will the story be?"
S1001743,P003,C0004,ED,,That will explain the cuts and bruises. You’d better say you were out. Stick to that. You know nothing. I’ll manage the doctor.
S1001745,P003,C0004,ED,,Can I trust you?
S1001747,P003,C0004,ED,,Then let’s have no more threats. You’ll support him?
S1001749,P003,C0004,ED,,You’ve had him six months; I’ll have him the next six. I’m not robbing you of him permanently.
S1001751,P003,C0004,ED,,No question of it. (Pause.) As long as you’re prepared to accept the idea of partnership.
S1001753,P003,C0004,ED,,As long as the agreement lasts.
S1001755,P003,C0004,ED,,By the half-year.
S1001757,P003,C0004,ED,,I’ve got no objections if he visits you from time to time. Briefly. We could put it in the contract. Fair enough?
S1001759,P003,C0004,ED,,"I’d bring him over myself in the car. Now, you’ll be more or less out of action for the next three months. So shall we say till next August? Agreed?"
S1001761,P003,C0004,ED,,Put it down to my experience at the conference table.
S1001763,P003,C0004,ED,,You’re not turning him into a mid-wife.
S1001765,P003,C0004,ED,,It’s all any reasonable child can expect if the dad is present at the conception. Let’s hear no more of it. Give me that locket.

S1001769,P003,C0004,ED,,"Well, it’s been a pleasant morning. See you later. ( He exits. The front door slams. KATH goes to the sideboard and rummages in drawer; takes out a sweet, unwraps it and puts it into her mouth. Sits on settee.)"

S1001779,P001,C0005,FRED,,And the nuts we roasted. All those nuts roasting in the flames. All those onions and potatoes in their jackets. Oh!

S1001789,P001,C0005,FRED,,People don’t know how to treat one another.
S1001791,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Think of the things that could be done to improve people’s lives; they could do a lot to make things pleasant. They might have cards printed saying charming, delightful, felicitous things, and they could distribute them. Give people refreshing smiles in the street. Oh, there’s a lot to be done. (Pause. Bitterly.) Not even a thank you!"
S1001793,P001,C0005,FRED,,They don’t raise their hats to a lady. Times are bad. Never raising a hat.

S1001811,P001,C0005,FRED,,I don’t know which way to turn.

S1001817,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ll be bald. I’ll be impotent. I’ll be unable to climb stairs. I’ll be cold in the middle of summer. I’ll be garrulous. I’ll be drawing the pension. And soon after that –
S1001818,P001,C0005,FRED,,"I’ll be dead. What am I doing sitting here talking when I’ll be dead? What am I doing, mouldering slowly into deaf and lonely old age? There’s something wrong somewhere."
S1001820,P001,C0005,FRED,,You ought to see a doctor.
S1001822,P001,C0005,FRED,,"No, you don’t. And you need faith."

S1001828,P001,C0005,FRED,,Think of the times we could have had. The wasted opportunities. (Pause. With inspiration.) I could have been a clergyman; think of that!

S1001840,P001,C0005,FRED,,I can’t bear it.
S1001842,P001,C0005,FRED,,The times I could have rung the bell and made out my returns and done overtime. Pounds out of pocket I am.

S1001850,P001,C0005,FRED,,"I’m going to pieces. This rushing about. Hurrying backwards and forwards. It’s driving me out of my mind. (Pause. In a panic.) Do you know, this morning I – I forgot where I was going. I didn’t know where I was going."

S1001862,P001,C0005,FRED,,"I found myself – there – in the street – wondering. I tell you straight, I’m All on edge. It’s the life we lead. This coming and going, and the things they put in the bread."
S1001864,P001,C0005,FRED,,"The chemicals they put in the bread. It’s not right. It’s not natural. They should leave it alone. Leave it alone and we’d be All right. (Pause.) Oh, I get such a funny feeling sometimes."
S1001866,P001,C0005,FRED,,Here. In my head. As though I were going to do something violent.

S1001902,P001,C0005,FRED,,I don’t care.
S1001904,P001,C0005,FRED,,It’s getting on my nerves the way she turns up day after day on exactly the same cue. You could tell the time by her.

S1001991,P001,C0005,FRED,,Sorry. Shall I try again?

S1002006,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Almost half-way. In another twenty-six years – not long is it, sir? – in twenty-six years I’ll be able to retire. I’m making exciting plans for my retirement, sir."
S1002007,P001,C0005,FRED,,"It isn’t long. Oh, the young people of today don’t know what they’re missing. They turn up their noses at jobs like this which offer security."
S1002008,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Yes sir, yes. The industry is definitely failing to attract the youth of today."
S1002009,P001,C0005,FRED,,"There are many reasons. First I think the young people of today want a job with more glamour. Though this is a rewarding job, sir. We have an excellent pension scheme. When I retire I shall be given a present by the firm, and a pension, and references in case I should take up part-time work during my retirement."
S1002010,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ve given the matter a lot of thought.
S1002011,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Yes, sir. She has a job which is stimulating, interesting and, above All, a benefit to society."

I’m bored with the pillowslips, and the counterpane, and the sheets and the eiderdown. I’m bored with that picture of a cat’s wedding hanging over the bed, and I’m going to smash the alarm clock which plays ‘Oh, What a Beautiful Morning’ beside the bed!"
S1002116,P001,C0005,FRED,,I will. Where have you put it? You’ve hidden it.

It’s not worth the risk."
S1002179,P001,C0005,FRED,,Those weekends at Mrs Gerald Legge’s and the horses and you’ll never look right in a Dior – and if you put two and two together with Uffa Fox you’ll be seasick. And then there’s the entertaining –
S1002182,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ll have to wear a bowler and carry a tightly rolled umbrella; what will the neighbours say?
S1002184,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’m warning you.
S1002186,P001,C0005,FRED,,Why?
S1002188,P001,C0005,FRED,,"It’s this social whirl; I’m not used to it. There’s the Royal Enclosure, and Janice – she’ll be coming out soon."
S1002190,P001,C0005,FRED,,"We’ll have to go to a Garden Party. And it’s so difficult to get floral gowns and those big hats – and what about grass stains on your gloves, eh? Have you thought about them? I don’t suppose you have. That’s your trouble. Thoughtless. It’s almost impossible to get grass stains from white gloves."
S1002192,P001,C0005,FRED,,Won’t go! Do you know what you’re saying?
S1002194,P001,C0005,FRED,,And how do you think Janice will feel? It’s not as if she asks a favour every day. What chance has she got of being voted ‘Deb of the Year’ if you behave like this? You’ll ruin her first season if you’re not careful.
S1002196,P001,C0005,FRED,,I suppose we could try Thawpit.
S1002199,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ll always love you.

S1002203,P001,C0005,FRED,,Do you like it?
S1002205,P001,C0005,FRED,,It’s not an original.
S1002223,P001,C0005,FRED,,A bit of an accident on my way to get married; I ought to be on my honeymoon.
S1002225,P001,C0005,FRED,,What happened?
S1002227,P001,C0005,FRED,,That’s the trouble with churches nowadays; it’s suicide to enter them. (Pause.) How is Janice keeping?

S1002245,P001,C0005,FRED,,He must be.
S1002248,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ve gone off that tune.
S1002250,P001,C0005,FRED,,I joined the Merchant Navy.

S1002256,P001,C0005,FRED,,Some of the lads enjoyed it.
S1002258,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Oh, yes! now that is something special. It’s unbelievable – like a huge biscuit box. You’d have loved it."

S1002275,P001,C0005,FRED,,"They are nice, aren’t they? I’ll leave them here. Nurse can see to them."
S1002277,P001,C0005,FRED,,We put it off; Susan’s down with jaundice.
S1002283,P001,C0005,FRED,,Long time no see?
S1002286,P001,C0005,FRED,,So you’re the Jimmy I’ve heard so much about?
S1002288,P001,C0005,FRED,,I certainly am.
S1002290,P001,C0005,FRED,,For the time being.
S1002292,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’ll take it on for a trial run.
S1002294,P001,C0005,FRED,,When would you like me to start?
S1002312,P001,C0005,FRED,,Could you lend me a hand with the beds?

S1002525,P001,C0005,FRED,,"It’s a lot of trouble rearing them. The thing is (I may be barking up the wrong tree) – the basic fault is, that they’re conventional at heart; they want a settled life, you see. And you can’t give it to them."
S1002527,P001,C0005,FRED,,You ought to have made enquiries before you took them on.
S1002528,P001,C0005,FRED,,You are in the wars.
S1002530,P001,C0005,FRED,,Why not hire. The Plant Hire Service is supposed to be good. You can get anything from a geranium to a cricket lawn. You pay a few bob each week.
S1002532,P001,C0005,FRED,,Why don’t you go in for these moods they’re advertising? I’m sure you’d get on better with them.
S1002534,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Yes. You can’t go wrong, they’re guaranteed. If any variety fails to please, the shops are authorised to refund full purchase price. You can’t be fairer than that."
S1002536,P001,C0005,FRED,,"That’s the way it goes. I’ll say one thing, they make a nice change. We had Disappointment and Rage for Christmas. It was a treat really. Susan’s on at me to try Despair – but I don’t fancy it."
S1002538,P001,C0005,FRED,,She swears by it. They have it every Monday morning regular.
S1002540,P001,C0005,FRED,,"The Royal Family are fond of Banality, though it has a funny effect on me. When they’re up to their eyes in Banality at some banquet I’m at home with Apathy, Agony, Anguish, Gloom and Heartache."

S1002623,P001,C0005,FRED,,Are we any of us old enough to remember the good old days?
S1002627,P001,C0005,FRED,,Do you remember –

S1002663,P001,C0005,FRED,,I rather like Brian. We do that quite well.

S1002686,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Oh, there’s definitely something queer about Brian."
S1002696,P001,C0005,FRED,,"We’re having a night out, Sykes, are you coming?"
S1002698,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Come on, it’s in a good cause. We’re going to laugh at some of the new buildings. Queenie did a lot of damage in the city over the weekend."
S1002700,P001,C0005,FRED,,Don’t breathe a word to Webber; he’s fond of the modern scene.
S1002709,P001,C0005,FRED,,Look at it out there – like the Everglades!
S1002711,P001,C0005,FRED,,You’d never stand the heat.
S1002713,P001,C0005,FRED,,It wants a lot of thinking about.
S1002715,P001,C0005,FRED,,Have you considered the drawbacks?
S1002717,P001,C0005,FRED,,There’s the banshees.
S1002720,P001,C0005,FRED,,It is anywhere.
S1002722,P001,C0005,FRED,,"It won’t be such a new life; it’ll be the old dog-eared, shop-soiled life in a new country. (Pause.) You haven’t taken the shape of the buildings into consideration, have you?"
S1002724,P001,C0005,FRED,,It’s easy to say that. You haven’t lived with buildings of a different shape. You’re used to our shapes.
S1002726,P001,C0005,FRED,,"You’re not prepared for the worst, are you?"
S1002728,P001,C0005,FRED,,And turbans. They’ll worry the life out of you.
S1002730,P001,C0005,FRED,,"How are you going to put up with sacred cows, and begging friars, and dervishes, and ruling castes; and are you prepared to bow to the Buddha’s tooth? I daresay you would be. (Pause.) They’ll never stand for you washing so much."
S1002732,P001,C0005,FRED,,I can’t picture you in a howdah. It won’t agree with you. And how will you cope with a teffinah or caftan?
S1002734,P001,C0005,FRED,,It’ll sap your vitality. (Pause.) The barbaric splendour –
S1002735,P001,C0005,FRED,,"The swaying palms and the camels and the seductive dances of the Murri-murri, oh I can see it All!"
S1002737,P001,C0005,FRED,,"There’s no getting away from it, the world’s a strange place."

S1002766,P001,C0005,FRED,,"And you, Grace?"
S1002768,P001,C0005,FRED,,"We’d better call it a day after this. What do you think, Sykes?"
S1002772,P001,C0005,FRED,,We can’t have reactions before the event.
S1002789,P001,C0005,FRED,,Dr Petrie first. Queenie – are you ready?
S1002791,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Dr Petrie will aim at the foundations, Sykes a little higher? Queenie and Madge are concentrating on the windows as usual, and Grace – is it okay if we leave the girders to you?"
S1002793,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Good. Then, off we go."
S1002813,P001,C0005,FRED,,"Now, just once more should do it. And then we’ll call it a day."
S1002834,P001,C0005,FRED,,See what you’ve done?
S1002836,P001,C0005,FRED,,I had nothing to say.
S1002838,P001,C0005,FRED,,Hallo.
S1002840,P001,C0005,FRED,,That’s no news; Queen Anne’s dead.

S1002853,P001,C0005,FRED,,He’s a stubborn man.
S1002861,P001,C0005,FRED,,Take Webber.
S1002867,P001,C0005,FRED,,It must get her down.
S1002871,P001,C0005,FRED,,She’s a phenomenon of the age.
S1002882,P001,C0005,FRED,,It’s a bit rum.

S1002926,P001,C0005,FRED,,It must be disheartening.
S1002927,P001,C0005,FRED,,Even allowing for the popularity of farce it’s been a long run.
S1002929,P001,C0005,FRED,,I’d say so.
S1002931,P001,C0005,FRED,,He’s past it.
S1002933,P001,C0005,FRED,,He’s over-publicised.
S1002935,P001,C0005,FRED,,It would be a pity if such an old-established firm went out of business.

S1002939,P001,C0005,FRED,,"The Dark Ages – they started them. Ignorance, Superstition, Barbarism – what a show! Intolerance, Bigotry – I could go on for hours."
S1002941,P001,C0005,FRED,,"And then, there was the burning of the books and works of art, anti-semitism, censorship, and a leader we could All look up to. You’d be surprised how many modern things are copyright."
S1002943,P001,C0005,FRED,,"The Inquisition ran it close. All those cardinals and Pope Paul III (he was one of those real old-time red-nosed comics, with a special line in off-colour jokes and heresy)."

S1002959,P001,C0005,FRED,,So we’re both jilted.
S1002961,P001,C0005,FRED,,She told me last night. (Pause. Sound of elephants.) Hark at them. I’ve always wanted elephants. I never dared to do anything about it.

S1001775,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How they leapt up the chimney.
S1001777,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We couldn’t look at the fire –
S1001778,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How bright it used to be.
S1001780,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"And there! think of the winter. It’s All right in the summer, but in the winter you’ll wish we’d never bothered. Bats are no company; they hibernate."
S1001782,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What about the time you tried to breed locusts?
S1001783,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t know; she has a lot on her –
S1001784,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A lot on her plate –
S1001786,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where does it All lead?
S1001788,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It isn’t good enough.
S1001790,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a shame.
S1001792,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They don’t stand up in the buses.
S1001795,P001,C0006,MADGE,,That’s what it is.
S1001797,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"You were always very perceptive, dear."
S1001802,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We’ve Janice to consider; she’s a growing girl.
S1001804,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She’s growing.
S1001806,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It wouldn’t be right for her sake.
S1001808,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She’s getting big now. She’s shooting up.
S1001810,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Yes, the expense is crippling."
S1001812,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It won’t always be the same.
S1001814,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We’ll be old.
S1001815,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Stop it, will you!"
S1001816,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Stop it!
S1001819,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What’s it All for? (Pause.) I’m so depressed. My nerves are on edge. I think I ought to see someone about it. I ought to see –
S1001821,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t have faith in doctors.
S1001823,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And I don’t have any. It’s no good. No good. Everything looks black. What future have we? We’ve no future.
S1001825,P001,C0006,MADGE,,No future.
S1001827,P001,C0006,MADGE,,None at All.
S1001829,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a good job.
S1001831,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s steady.
S1001833,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s stimulating. (Pause.) It’s stimulating.
S1001835,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It helps to make the world go round.
S1001837,P001,C0006,MADGE,,There’s a lot of climbing stairs on the double-deckers. (In anguish.) What if you were on a single-decker? Oh!
S1001839,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Oh!
S1001841,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I can’t bear it. If you were on a single-decker and they made you climb the stairs – the danger!
S1001843,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"So dangerous! I’d be a widow. Think of Janice and me left alone. Don’t do it, for our sakes."
S1001845,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"What am I going to tell Janice? – she thinks the world of you,"
S1001847,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Perhaps it was dye.
S1001849,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Perhaps it was dye.
S1001851,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You worry too much.
S1001853,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Tossing and turning in your sleep. Worry, worry, worry."
S1001855,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where were you coming from; that’s more to the point?
S1001857,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You don’t know?
S1001859,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You don’t know where you were coming from either?
S1001861,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s very worrying.
S1001863,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Chemicals.
S1001865,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Funny feeling?
S1001867,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Something violent.
S1001870,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why not? I have a right to know. I’m your wife. And – Fred – listen to me.
S1001872,P001,C0006,MADGE,,If –
S1001874,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1001876,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, dear."
S1001877,P001,C0006,MADGE,,To Janice?
S1001879,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A change is as good as a rest.
S1001881,P001,C0006,MADGE,,The weather’s bad.
S1001883,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Clear the chairs –
S1001884,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It’s bitter out. I can’t stand the cold. I’m not strong, not strong at All."
S1001886,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Hallo.
S1001889,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You know very well. Don’t you?
S1001891,P001,C0006,MADGE,,There’s no need to show off because Queenie’s here. A lamp-post is All we need. You can put that back where you found it and behave yourself.
S1001893,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When are you going to stop making a show of yourself? Every time she comes you play up.
S1001895,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She’s my sister.
S1001897,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She can’t help it.
S1001899,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It isn’t her fault.
S1001901,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"What do you imagine she must think of you, making an exhibition of yourself?"
S1001903,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I believe you do it on purpose.
S1001905,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m not listening to any more. You’d better go and find that Arthur you’re so fond of.
S1001907,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Just a minute. (Fetches an umbrella from the back of the stage.) Now –
S1001908,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I can’t seem to get her to stop the habit of dusting when she’s excited.
S1001910,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She’s had a nasty cold.
S1001912,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Look at her now – brushing the steps. I’m thinking of having her trained.
S1001914,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"She’s got it in her, I’m sure. (Pause.) I gave you a ring last night; weren’t you in?"
S1001916,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I must keep my eyes open. He’s too mean to buy the Television Times so we never know when anything is on. I missed Fabulous Camay yesterday.
S1001919,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And you saw her?
S1001921,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What kind of a horse?
S1001923,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Black? She seems to go for big BLACK –
S1001924,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"She works so hard, poor thing. I’m sure she overdoes it."
S1001926,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m sure she does. I only hope she won’t –
S1001928,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What I think is so nice is she’s just the same as you and me. I feel she gets up in the morning feeling a couple of degrees under just like us.
S1001930,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"When her sister got married she didn’t bat an eyelid, did she?"
S1001932,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She didn’t bat an eyelid; though you and I noticed a thing or two. Though we noticed the way the wind blew. She takes after her granny. SHE was a grand old –
S1001934,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A real –
S1001936,P001,C0006,MADGE,,With a heart of gold and a –
S1001937,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Truth is certainly stranger than fiction. But I like them. They’re a grand lot. So homely. You feel they’re just like US.
S1001939,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It suited her.
S1001941,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Her auntie’s hubby is some kind of a relation of her hubby, isn’t he?"
S1001943,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I’m All against it myself, though they seem to be managing."
S1001945,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Her hubby must be a sport to have around. They must get on well together, because she’s the same, you know?"
S1001946,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"She only looks at home with a scarf over her perm at a race-course, or watching polo, or cricket. She clearly never has an intelligent thought in her head (and neither does he for that matter) and that’s what I like to see."
S1001948,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And what about her mother?
S1001950,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Her mother and her sister’s hubby seem as thick as thieves.
S1001952,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t say for a minute –
S1001954,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"She wouldn’t like that at All, would she? I’d say she wouldn’t. I’d say she wouldn’t. And yet, if the worst came to the worst, she’d take it in her stride. She is a miracle. No one but her… no one else in the world… could draw such crowds, attract such cheers and win such warm affection. For she is the only person in the WORLD whose grace and charm cut through race, creed, religion and politics. Why everyone has a soft spot for her. WITHOUT EXCEPTION. The whole world shares the ideals she represents. And that’s what I always say. She’s a trouper. She’s one of the best. SHE IS A LADY. I’ll say she is. And don’t you let me catch any of you forgetting it."
S1001955,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t know how it happened.
S1001957,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Never, apart from illness. I’ve never missed an episode. I must be slipping."
S1001959,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ve a lot on my mind.
S1001961,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1001963,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s him.
S1001965,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I don’t know. Everything seems too much trouble. Like the lamp-post. Look at him now, where is he? (Crosses the stage and calls.) Fred!"
S1001967,P001,C0006,MADGE,,All he ever thinks of is messing about with Arthur.
S1001969,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m going inside; it’s not my business.
S1001971,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He’s gone and left the place to look after itself.
S1001973,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re always covering up. One of these days you won’t be here – and what will he do then?
S1001978,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Me? Why should I care? Oh! this wind! I’m going inside out of it.
S1002012,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Hallo, Queenie, I didn’t know you worked here."
S1002014,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What a thing to happen.
S1002019,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It may never happen.
S1002021,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I know what you mean.
S1002024,P001,C0006,MADGE,,There you are. Pride goes before a fall.
S1002028,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Look out, Glad! some of the holes in your sieve are blocked. You’ll be catching water in it if you don’t watch yourself."
S1002031,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We All do a good day’s work and the pay is good.
S1002034,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’d see someone if I were you.
S1002038,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Do shut up, Glad, you’re getting on my nerves."
S1002042,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ll make your life a misery if you go on like this.
S1002044,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When does she leave school?
S1002046,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She won a scholarship didn’t she?
S1002052,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s not easy for women to get jobs on the Wheel.
S1002057,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"And Apple-Graspers, and Oath-Takers and Corpse-Judgers?"
S1002061,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And God only knows you’ve done that. Spoiled her until she thinks she’s the mistress of the house and not you. Now if I were in your shoes I’d put her in the Winding-Sheet business.
S1002063,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You won’t find a nicer job.
S1002067,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ve made your bed and you must lie on it.
S1002069,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Thank God it’s Saturday tomorrow. I’m no friend of the man who invented work.
S1002073,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I remember her.
S1002080,P001,C0006,MADGE,,About time too.
S1002082,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I suppose you’ll be home about six?
S1002084,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’d better. It’ll come in handy for Janice’s new shoes. I’ll keep your dinner hot.
S1002086,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He’s not home yet.
S1002088,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They asked him to do overtime.
S1002089,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"So, so."
S1002091,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m under the weather; it’s the time of year.
S1002093,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Janice? I’ve put her to bed, she’s had a tiring day. We’re having her trained, you know?"
S1002095,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It was his idea. I wasn’t too keen. There you are. A proud father and All that.
S1002098,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"No more than an ordinary lamp, and the litter basket comes in handy."
S1002100,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We must be modern.
S1002104,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What about the scene where I leave him?
S1002106,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"If you say so. (Pause. As Webber exits.) You can find your own way out, can you?"
S1002109,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where have you been?
S1002111,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why?
S1002113,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You have no reason to be.
S1002115,P001,C0006,MADGE,,No you won’t.
S1002117,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh! Oh, dear! Fred! Fred! Don’t do it. We shan’t be able to wake up. I’m frightened, I’ve never seen you like this. I like the clock."
S1002119,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It’s cheerful. I like ‘Oh, What a Beautiful Morning’."
S1002121,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Cheerful, yes."
S1002123,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why not?
S1002125,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Leave it alone. I won’t have you behaving like this. You’ll wake Janice.
S1002127,P001,C0006,MADGE,,The craftsmanship takes your breath away. It’s a work of art.
S1002128,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Think of the time it took to make anything so perfect!
S1002130,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a lovely piece of work. So elaborate. So decorative.
S1002133,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"And I say, What time is it, dear? (Pause.) It’s a sacred moment."
S1002135,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"So kind you always are to me. It must take a lot of patient searching to find the time. You’re a good husband. Nothing is too much trouble. (Pause.) Well, carry on."
S1002137,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ve no idea of the funny feeling I get inside as I watch you take off your pyjama jacket. I watch too long. I’ve been over-exciting myself lately. That’s why I’m so tired All day.
S1002139,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I never dare to look. It’s so personal. I close my eyes and hear you say –
S1002140,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes. You say –
S1002141,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We lead a deeply human life. There’s no getting away from it. So moving and quietly sincere.
S1002142,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I knew you would. I knew you’d be struck by the solemnity of everyday life.
S1002144,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It’s classical in its simplicity. (Pause.) Oh, the beauty of it, dear, the beauty of it. Have you ever considered that? We’re not just part of a mass, you and I. No. We’re joined to a living integral whole, a warm, pulsating body bound together; you, me, and Mr Macmillan and Mr Lennox-Boyd and Lord Hailsham and Mr Cotton and Mr Clore, All bound together in a wonderful experience called LIVING. (Pause.) So – poetic – don’t you think?"
S1002145,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You didn’t know I had a touch of the –
S1002148,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You didn’t know I had that side. It’s the –
S1002151,P001,C0006,MADGE,,These are the quiet thoughts that come to me in the morning as I wait for you to bring me my cup of tea –
S1002152,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I’ve revealed new and unsuspected realms of imagination, of unique and lasting value in our marriage. These little thoughts of mine, and much more, show my awed recognition of the mystery at the heart of life."
S1002155,P001,C0006,MADGE,,The mat in the hall; the letter box.
S1002156,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It’s an experience, seeing our hall in the dawn, as the sun rises. All that light coming ninety-three million miles through space to shine on our Welcome mat."
S1002158,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And the shoe cupboard.
S1002160,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And the picture from the Medici gallery.
S1002162,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When we win the pools I’m going to buy a machine to do it. We’ll have no bother any more.
S1002164,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m desperately concerned about the money; desperately concerned.

S1002168,P001,C0006,MADGE,,The cocktails and laughter; will they spoil us?
S1002170,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We must make a determined effort not to let our newfound wealth affect us – but we must have serviettes with our meals. Now that’s a thing I shall insist on.

S1002174,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, dear!"

S1002178,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re trying to put me off.
S1002180,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You make it sound awful.
S1002181,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Please stop.
S1002183,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"1 don’t know what’s the matter with you, you’ve never been like this before."
S1002185,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I get so tired of it All, so desperately tired. I’m unhappy."
S1002187,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re leaving me.
S1002189,P001,C0006,MADGE,,FRED
S1002191,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I won’t go then.

S1002195,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Don’t let me stop you going. I’m sure you’re dying to be with the others.

S1002200,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a pity we couldn’t make a go of it.
S1002202,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What a nice idea.
S1002204,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It suits you down to the ground.
S1002206,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I think it’s every bit as good; nobody could tell the difference.
S1002222,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What are you doing here?
S1002224,P001,C0006,MADGE,,So should I.
S1002226,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We had an accident too. The church roof came in on top of us.
S1002228,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She polishes beautifully. She’s a born Cleansing Agent. So talented! (Pause.) Listen! Our tune!
S1002230,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"About six years. I never realised his feelings until a few months ago. (Pause.) It was a whirlwind courtship, when I took Janice to Norfolk to convalesce."

S1002234,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Hills! – oh! the climbing we had to do. Up and down, up and down, All day long. I got worried for Janice’s health. She’s been poorly lately."
S1002236,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She overtaxed her strength working for this carpet beating exam she’s so keen on passing. (Pause.) What about – her – you didn’t tell me her name.
S1002238,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How old is she?
S1002241,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Jimmy.
S1002243,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Sixty-one.
S1002244,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He’s very dynamic.
S1002246,P001,C0006,MADGE,,That’s what first attracted me to him. We were doing a spot of climbing –
S1002247,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Yes. We were more or less amusing ourselves, Janice and I, until she lost her alpenstock, and we found ourselves stranded. With night coming on, and reports of avalanches, we were terrified, when, out of nowhere, came Jimmy. Suave, immaculate, devil-may-care, the epitome of All that a lonely woman could desire. And he had two alpenstocks. So he loaned one to Janice and helped us back to the chalet. (Pause.) He proposed to me next day."
S1002249,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What have you been doing lately; you never write.
S1002251,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Like it?
S1002253,P001,C0006,MADGE,,China must be interesting.
S1002255,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And Japan.
S1002257,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Did you go to India? And see the Taj Mahal?
S1002259,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Queenie married an Indian chap, did you hear?"
S1002261,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"She’s leaving soon to take up residence in the Palace of the Mogul Emperors at Sutpura. I can’t fancy the place myself, but she’s looking forward to it. (Pause.) She wanted to take young Janice, because there’ll be All those rooms to clean. I wouldn’t hear of it. Janice is at the start of her career; it wouldn’t be fair to her. (Pause.) What’s the good of a Diploma in polishing if the floors are made of stone? No sense in it. So I put my foot down."
S1002263,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"The end of the year. She’s taking lessons in nudedancing, and getting used to cobras – we have the spare room full of them."
S1002265,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I thought that’d interest you.
S1002267,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Shall I ever forget the trouble we had when they escaped?
S1002269,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I never regret our marriage, Fred."
S1002271,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When is visiting day?
S1002272,P001,C0006,MADGE,,FRED
S1002274,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I am now. What lovely flowers!
S1002276,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How was the wedding?
S1002278,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What a shame.
S1002280,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Look who’s here.
S1002282,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A few days ago.
S1002284,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He’s getting married soon.
S1002296,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I’m sorry for his poor wife, what a time she must have."
S1002301,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He can’t help it.
S1002303,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Aren’t they lovely! Leave them there. Nurse will know what to do with them.
S1002304,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Very happy.
S1002306,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He was as upset as we were.
S1002308,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You might have been killed too.
S1002310,P001,C0006,MADGE,,My gown – my lovely gown! (Bursts into tears.)
S1002338,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They’re so passionate.
S1002340,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They make such a lot of it.
S1002342,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What I might call –
S1002346,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I can see someone having his wedding breakfast in the loo.
S1002348,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1002349,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They are nice.
S1002351,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a nice thought; it’s the thought that matters.
S1002353,P001,C0006,MADGE,,By registered post.
S1002355,P001,C0006,MADGE,,That once belonged to Sir Malcolm Sargent.
S1002357,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Wally and Joan.
S1002359,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Don’t touch the string of pearls whatever you do; Olive sent it and she forgot to wrap them in greaseproof paper.
S1002361,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1002364,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She could serve three people at once.
S1002366,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1002368,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I wish she’d oblige; give a helping hand.
S1002371,P001,C0006,MADGE,,They looked so –
S1002374,P001,C0006,MADGE,,ELEGANT –
S1002376,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You could hardly call it a wedding last time. He had a sudden impulse and we decided to use it and get married.
S1002378,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Just like that.
S1002391,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Who were you talking to?
S1002397,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, yes. He’d much sooner have been an animal hater but we couldn’t afford it."
S1002406,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m not satisfied that Dad is well enough to work. He’s not getting any younger.
S1002408,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It isn’t right – an Old Man of his age, just out of hospital, having to work for his living, polishing the silver, running up and down stairs, answering the door and telephone. It isn’t good enough, Queenie. You always were inconsiderate."
S1002410,P001,C0006,MADGE,,That’s beside the point.
S1002413,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You asked people here to stay?
S1002415,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Grace Old bourne
S1002417,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And a famous one.
S1002419,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why are they coming?
S1002421,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I know what it is – the Sunday papers have sent them. You can’t deny it, can you?"
S1002423,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Well, they can go right back again."
S1002426,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You must be out of your mind!
S1002428,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why pick on us? Other people get married every day.
S1002431,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s awful.
S1002433,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Only for Queenie’s sake. I know she’d never raise her head again if the crocodile story leaked out.
S1002435,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"The best thing to do is to pretend nothing has happened. Queenie, you’d better come with me – I haven’t unpacked All the presents."
S1002458,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re both so kind. It’s going to be nice having you.
S1002460,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I don’t know what kind of people you usually choose – our guests are ordinary people, they have no brains to speak of – except my uncle Bob, but he’ll give no trouble."
S1002464,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m sure we’d All be delighted.
S1002466,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Anybody.
S1002473,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Audrey Russell.
S1002483,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ll be an asset at the wedding.
S1002487,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She couldn’t do better than come to the wedding. I’m sure Dr Petrie and Miss Old bourne
S1002504,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It sounds a lovely job.
S1002509,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Lady Barnet.
S1002584,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"All work and no play, Dr Petrie."
S1002587,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ve been looking up All your cases. You did cause the riot at the Guildhall luncheon?
S1002590,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re surely never going to give offence to millions?
S1002592,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Well, I wish you the best of luck."
S1002595,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I am lucky.
S1002598,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A doornail (in extremis). However did she think of that? Did you tell her?
S1002600,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I hope you were tactful. Fanny has promised a lovely collection of P’s and Q’s; so we shan’t have to buy any for ages.
S1002602,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Wilkins, would you bring the presents in here, please?"
S1002604,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Did the car meet you, Jimmy?"
S1002606,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"You pet! to walk! Isn’t that original, Dr Petrie?"
S1002610,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Your mother. Actually they’re for me. She’s given you an Oedipus complex, and that ought to be enough. (Lifting the presents.) A roll of haywire, an old wife’s tail, a potted itching palm, a duck’s arse, and grandstand tickets for the rat race – they’ll come in useful. Are we entering by the way?"
S1002613,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"As a matter of fact, it’s a plastic want. There was no label so I’m not sure who it came from."
S1002616,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And Milly has given me what for; isn’t that just like her? She always was mean. (Pausing to look at another gift.) What a fantastic present to receive – a milk-jug and sugar basin!
S1002618,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Uncle Bob.
S1002621,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"There’s always room for one more. Dr Petrie, Miss Old bourne"
S1002634,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Very much alive –
S1002636,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Before we lost our money –
S1002647,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Very much in the old days.
S1002653,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Now, Fred, you can have too much of a good thing!"
S1002655,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Let me see, Picnics, Sunlight, the River, Father and Mother, Before the War, Losing Our Money– Oh! we’ve forgotten the cost of living."
S1002657,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We might stretch a point.
S1002661,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"What do you think, Dr Petrie?"
S1002662,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Who shall it be then?
S1002664,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"You begin, Dr Petrie. I always think the first line needs weight."
S1002666,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Brian doesn’t want to play.
S1002672,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where did he get those shoes?
S1002687,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I don’t think anybody could grumble at that, could they?"
S1002689,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Isn’t it?
S1002691,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Well, we’ve always called it Modern Youth, Dr Petrie, and I think it’d better stay that way, if you don’t mind."
S1002693,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Thank you, Wilkins."
S1002694,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Do you mind if I go in with Dr Petrie, Grace?"
S1002710,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I feel so guilty. (Pause.) They’re sending Dad to the Middle East to see what he can do for the Arabs. And Queenie’s off to India after the wedding. (Pause.) I’ve half-promised to go with her.
S1002712,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I could take over the Mistress of the Robes’ job.
S1002714,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1002716,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"No, I’m leaving the drawbacks till we get out there and then I can consider them at my leisure."
S1002718,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, dear!"
S1002719,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I can take care of myself. Living’s impossible over here.
S1002721,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’ll be a new life.
S1002723,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ll get used to them.
S1002725,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’ll make a change.
S1002727,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’m looking forward to it.
S1002729,P001,C0006,MADGE,,All I have to do is – keep calm.
S1002731,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Queenie told me not to worry.
S1002733,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You don’t understand. I’ll be the Mistress of the Robes – it’s only Gladys that’s going into the harem.
S1002736,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I feel as though I’m in a different world.
S1002738,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You can’t deny it.
S1002740,P001,C0006,MADGE,,The East India Company –
S1002743,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We’ll be in the hills; above the Eternal Snows.
S1002745,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How did we come to lose it?
S1002747,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He wants us to give Gibraltar to the Spaniards.
S1002748,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We should have been firm.
S1002750,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Shot the lot of them.
S1002754,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I only planted them last week.
S1002757,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I can’t face the ivy – it’s getting beyond a joke. We’ll go through the French windows and risk it.
S1002759,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s still on order.
S1002760,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I bet you are. You should have left the Festival Hall alone.
S1002762,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Bitten off more than you can chew, haven’t you?"
S1002774,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It isn’t logic.
S1002776,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, very well."
S1002788,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What’s the order?
S1002795,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t like All that red. (Laughs.)
S1002799,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It gives me the horrors. (Laughs.)
S1002805,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Oh, hallo, Jimmy. I didn’t know you were coming."
S1002807,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I said I’d help Fred. He organised the outing.
S1002811,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Yes, oh yes!"
S1002814,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where’s Dad?
S1002816,P001,C0006,MADGE,,No.
S1002818,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Packing?
S1002820,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He has to make a show of himself.
S1002822,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Know?
S1002824,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Who did that?
S1002826,P001,C0006,MADGE,,How are we ever going to get to church?
S1002829,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We shan’t be able to stay here. Life isn’t worth living if you have to go on safari for groceries.
S1002831,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Does it matter.
S1002833,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It All seems so difficult! (Bursts into tears.)
S1002842,P001,C0006,MADGE,,That’s a silly thing to do.
S1002844,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You ought to have kept some of them.
S1002846,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Values do deteriorate fast.
S1002849,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Wally and Joan had a lovely wartime attitude – what use is it now?
S1002852,P001,C0006,MADGE,,He looks such a fool on Sundays.
S1002854,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Wilful.
S1002858,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Perverts! What a lyrical concept!
S1002862,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Or Mrs Dale –
S1002863,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Definitely.
S1002865,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She’s a modest woman.
S1002869,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She has lovely ways with her.
S1002872,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Definitely.
S1002878,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"You’re too sensitive, Queenie."
S1002880,P001,C0006,MADGE,,No. Wait.
S1002881,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t like that attitude. (Pause.) It’s in advance of avant-garde. (Pause.) Don’t you think so!
S1002887,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You must get a better attitude than that.
S1002889,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Cheerio.
S1002891,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Everyone’s entitled to their opinions.
S1002892,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When?
S1002894,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Where is it?
S1002896,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Wilkins, isn’t there a note for me?"
S1002898,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’d like to see it.
S1002900,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What’s he got up in that outfit for? Enough to frighten the crows.
S1002902,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A fine thing when he has to make a laughing stock of himself at his age.
S1002904,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Thank you, Wilkins."
S1002907,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Who?
S1002909,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Should he be?
S1002911,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ve lost him?
S1002913,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We’d better send out search parties.
S1002919,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I wouldn’t have such a thing happen to a clergyman, it isn’t right."
S1002921,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Now, Fred! Don’t blaspheme. I’m not what you’d call religious, but I do like to show respect. I will say one thing for the vicar, he did know when to kneel and when to stand. It’s not easy."
S1002923,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"I went with Janice to St Christopher’s last week, and we got everything wrong. She didn’t know when to kneel and when to sit."
S1002925,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"You do. Mind you, the vicar was very nice. He invited us backstage to his dressing-room afterwards, said he was sorry there wasn’t more of an audience."
S1002928,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Exactly. After two thousand years they must have recovered production costs.
S1002930,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"The vicar is All for a good press agent, a better business manager, and a new producer. But I said, ‘Vicar, you’ll never have any luck unless you change your star.’"
S1002932,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ve never been keen on him.
S1002934,P001,C0006,MADGE,,So the vicar admitted that in a last resort the management were prepared to get rid of one or two members of the cast.
S1002936,P001,C0006,MADGE,,A great pity.
S1002938,P001,C0006,MADGE,,At prices well within our means.
S1002940,P001,C0006,MADGE,,St Paul! what a comedian.
S1002942,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Did you ever see anything to beat the Acts of the Apostles? It was a real hoot.
S1002944,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What about the Lambeth Palace mob?
S1002946,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"This book of theirs is a best-seller, and from the bits I’ve seen it deserves to be."
S1002948,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Mind you, I don’t think the Church ought to take the micky out of the Bible; it isn’t right."
S1002950,P001,C0006,MADGE,,She ordered them for two o’clock.
S1002952,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I don’t know.
S1002954,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Go? Where? And Jimmy? He’d be so upset if he came and found we’d gone without him.
S1002956,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Did you think I would?
S1002958,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1002960,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Has Susan –
S1002962,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a dangerous obsession.
S1002964,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Why don’t you come with us?
S1002966,P001,C0006,MADGE,,To India.
S1002968,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ll be sorry.
S1002970,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’ll lead a life of regret.
S1002972,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’d be so happy looking after the beasts.
S1002974,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Rhinos.
S1002976,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And as many snakes as you could count.
S1002978,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Peacocks, macaws, widgeons, eagles."
S1002980,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Don’t stand there thinking about it.
S1002982,P001,C0006,MADGE,,No.

S1002987,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Not with a smart hat and a pair of boots – no one could prove inadequate.
S1002989,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"It’s not good for you, All this indecision. It’s silly to say it keeps you from making mistakes, it doesn’t. And even if it did that would be no excuse."
S1002990,P001,C0006,MADGE,,What kind of things?
S1002992,P001,C0006,MADGE,,And what’s wrong with that?
S1002994,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"If you don’t like them, why do you listen?"
S1002996,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I think it needs looking into. You ought to see old Johnson.
S1002998,P001,C0006,MADGE,,When did it happen?
S1003000,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It was that surgery of his.
S1003002,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Without the vicar.
S1003004,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Some relation of Jimmy’s.
S1003006,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes. (Pause.) What do these voices say?
S1003008,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Is that All?
S1003010,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You shouldn’t listen. No good will come of it.
S1003012,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ve lost count. Forty – forty-five.
S1003014,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s a sad life.
S1003016,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Yes.
S1003018,P001,C0006,MADGE,,All the foreign parts unvisited.
S1003020,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We’re not married!
S1003022,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I must have missed it.
S1003025,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Queenie’s getting impatient. (Pause.) What were you doing before I came in?
S1003027,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Oh. (Pause.) That shouldn’t be difficult.
S1003029,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You need a better brain.
S1003031,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"If you’d received an education, I daresay you could have done it."
S1003033,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You’re a failure.
S1003035,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You can dream.
S1003037,P001,C0006,MADGE,,You could die.

S1003044,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I’ll be getting along.
S1003046,P001,C0006,MADGE,,I have to dress for the part.
S1003086,P001,C0006,MADGE,,This is a wonderful dream-fantasy.
S1003088,P001,C0006,MADGE,,"Dr Petrie, will you carry on from here? I think we All trust you."
S1003094,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Rising.
S1003097,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Not Zulus.
S1003099,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Just because you fancy yourself in feathers is no excuse for becoming a Zulu.
S1003101,P001,C0006,MADGE,,It’s too late now; we had to budget.
S1003106,P001,C0006,MADGE,,India is well within our means.
S1003111,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Mustn’t be allowed to hamper a fantasy.
S1003112,P001,C0006,MADGE,,We must remember to be polite.

S1003125,P001,C0006,MADGE,,Waiting to take us away. (Ship’s siren.)
S1001885,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I’ve arrived.
S1001887,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What’s the matter with him?
S1001892,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Sorry if I barged in. See you in a bit, then?"
S1001906,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,All ready?
S1001909,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"She’s highly strung, that’s what it is."
S1001911,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’s looking peaky.
S1001913,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Trained?
S1001915,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"It was you, was it? I heard the phone go about eight. We were watching the re-makes of those detergent adverts."
S1001917,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"What a shame. (Absently.) You didn’t miss her, did you?"
S1001918,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"My word, yes."
S1001920,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,We were so excited. She was on a horse.
S1001922,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Big made, you know. And black."
S1001925,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Do you really think so? Do you really think so?
S1001927,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I’m sure she won’t.
S1001929,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,And more.
S1001931,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She certainly did not.
S1001933,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Lady, SHE was."
S1001935,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Lady –
S1001938,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Her auntie was a nice woman. It came as a big shock to me when I heard she’d passed over. A big shock. She’d always been my favourite. Didn’t she look impressive in her uniform?
S1001940,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It brought her out.
S1001942,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Do you think that’s wise?
S1001944,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,If you read between the lines.
S1001947,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Oh, well, naturally. It runs in the family, doesn’t it? They can’t help the way they’re made, can they?"
S1001949,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What about her mother? What about her mother? I don’t know.
S1001951,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,NO!
S1001953,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Oh, I’m sure you must be mistaken –"
S1001956,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"You, of All people. You’re usually so keen. You never miss a single episode, do you?"
S1001958,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You must be slipping.
S1001960,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Worries?
S1001962,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Private matter?
S1001964,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What’s the matter with him?
S1001966,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’s in the back with Arthur.
S1001968,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What are we going to do? (Shivers.) It’s cold out here.
S1002013,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I’m deputising for Enid, she’s being taken to court over not paying her telly licence."
S1002015,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’s been asking for it.
S1002017,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,We can All guess; it’s Short Time.
S1002023,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Enid’s mum was ever so shocked about Enid being taken to court.

S1002030,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Yes.
S1002032,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It is.
S1002035,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,There’s something wrong.
S1002037,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Don’t!
S1002040,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,The Grain-Sorters are on short time.
S1002048,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,That’s a funny job for a woman.
S1002051,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s a man’s profession.
S1002053,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Jobs for women are scarce. Whereas the chances of women making a success of water-sieving are good.
S1002055,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,And the Straw-Spinners?

S1002060,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"You’ve spoiled her, Glad –"
S1002065,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’s spoilt.
S1002068,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Five and twenty past! How time flies.
S1002071,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Anna Neagle’s on tonight.
S1002074,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Did you see the original?
S1002076,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Yes, they did a revival, I believe."
S1002081,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Never mind, dear, we All love you."
S1002085,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"He needs a good tonic; try him on Parish’s Food, that’s good."
S1002313,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Excuse me for saying this, but how is it you look so similar to poor Gladys?"
S1002315,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,That was lucky.
S1002318,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What’s your name?
S1002320,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What a coincidence.
S1002322,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What do you mean?
S1002324,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I still don’t.
S1002326,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s a personal matter.
S1002327,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I’ll say this for you, you’re out for what’s going."
S1002329,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,A joke’s a joke.
S1002331,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’s only advertising for concubines.
S1002333,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You’d have to see Ramakrishna.

S1002350,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Asparagus tongs. You never eat any.
S1002352,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You have some lovely presents. When did these come?
S1002354,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"A wig-scraper, six demon spoons, a stuffed owl, a nanny-goat’s postiche, an ear (oh, you are lucky, it’s got a flea in it), a fully automatic oubliette, an artificial chin, a yard of linoleum –"
S1002356,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Who sent this wicker coffin?
S1002358,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s just what you wanted!
S1002360,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s such a pity Janice is busy at Windsor Castle. What a boon she’d be at the wedding.
S1002362,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What a treasure.
S1002363,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’d be a great help with plates.
S1002365,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’ll have lost the knack.
S1002367,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She could have laid the table very nice.
S1002369,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She was good with serviettes.

S1002373,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,So –
S1002379,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I’ve still got a soft spot for old Fred.
S1002380,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She should never have divorced him.
S1002382,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,The bats came between them.
S1002384,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He kept vampires and she saw red because they’d had a lot of trouble with them on their honeymoon. It was in All the papers when they escaped.
S1002386,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,What?
S1002388,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I can’t think what’s come over everybody, wanting to read about people’s private affairs. What are we going to do? We must stop publication. If Fred were here he’d think of something."
S1002390,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,We ought to do something. There’s such a thing as privacy.
S1002392,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It was a wrong number.
S1002394,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Since when?
S1002396,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He only took up animal loving out of boredom. Didn’t he Madge?
S1002398,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I don’t see why, you were perfectly welcome to join in the conversation."
S1002401,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,How?
S1002407,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’ll take him out of himself.
S1002409,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He gets paid.
S1002414,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You behave in a very high-handed manner.
S1002424,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I think it’s taking a liberty. You ought to have asked permission first; it isn’t fair.
S1002427,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s taking a mean advantage.
S1002429,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Yes – why not the MacDougals? Sally MacDougal had a lovely little insult paid to her the other day – she won’t mind.
S1002434,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I don’t know what things are coming to.
S1002461,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Give us a trial. Insult someone.

S1002474,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Joan Littlewood.

S1002552,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I’m not speaking to you. If everybody had their deserts you’d be in prison by now – making the garden look a mess. It’s spreading, you know that, don’t you? You’ll have to be put in some kind of an institution if you carry on like this."
S1002554,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Oh yes it has. You’ve been up to something silly. The park looks like the Sahara. I don’t know what the council will say when they find out. They’ll lock you up.
S1002555,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Leave it alone. Madge wants you. It’ll be teatime soon and who’s going to pour the tea?
S1002557,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,WiniFRED
S1002559,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Been waiting long?

S1002565,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Oh, good! I am glad."
S1002567,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Who did you see?
S1002569,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’s the chief eunuch.
S1002570,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You’ll have to be careful when we get out there; some of these eunuchs aren’t All they seem. (Pause.) Did he give you your grading?
S1002572,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,That’s the highest. You’ll be in attendance on Ramakrishna in person.
S1002574,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Good God, no! Some of the concubines he inherited from his grandfather. He can’t get rid of them, it wouldn’t be right. On the other hand he can’t use them. So he generally gives them away to visiting royalty."
S1002576,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I wonder if Madge –
S1002578,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I will, when I get the chance. (Pause.) Those pale hands of yours will come in useful at last."
S1002580,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I’ll take you with me to Madam Sarasvati next time I go – you’ll soon get the hang of dancing with a jewel in your navel, and a yashmak should present no special problem. As you pass the upstairs loo, take a peep at the cobras; get used to the idea. We’re trying to persuade the Zoo to lend us an elephant for an hour or so; you’ve no idea of the bother involved!"
S1002701,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"He’s put the whole thing in reverse, Glad, and he doesn’t seem to know how."
S1002703,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He has no sense of proportion
S1002705,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"It couldn’t be worse. Hampstead Heath has joined up with Regent’s Park around Euston – they’re using porters as beaters to find the platforms at King’s Cross, and the new road improvements are ruined at Hyde Park, and they’re getting up a grouse shoot in Old Compton Street."
S1002707,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"The Forestry Commission have been round, but he doesn’t understand how it came to happen. And the inconvenience he’s causing; Harrods are in the middle of a woodland glade."
S1002753,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s taken us the best part of half-an-hour getting through the primulas.
S1002756,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,We’d better go the front way.
S1002758,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I thought he was going to get a flame-thrower?

S1002763,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Just let me get my breath back.
S1002770,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Wait for me. I can’t start yet.
S1002773,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Reactions first, events afterwards."
S1002790,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Yes.
S1002798,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I wouldn’t work there. (Laughs.)
S1002815,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Do you want him?
S1002817,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’s packing.
S1002819,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,They’re fetching him after the ceremony.
S1002821,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He can’t go by the road – oh! you don’t know?
S1002823,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Look! (Points out of the windows.)
S1002825,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It’s those runner beans – I said you shouldn’t have planted them with him as he is.
S1002827,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I asked the vicar to come here. Grace has gone to fetch him. I told her to notch each beanstalk as she passed.
S1002828,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,It is depressing.
S1002830,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Things are never as bad as they seem. Look on the bright side. (Pause.) I hope Grace won’t insult the vicar before she gets him into the forest.
S1002832,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’ll take offence and get away.
S1002835,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You’re no help. Standing there without opening your mouth.
S1002843,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,You’ll regret it.
S1002847,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Old-fashioned values are no use.
S1002850,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,None.
S1002855,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Nothing makes a man so ridiculous as an old-fashioned attitude.

S1002859,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"Go on, go on! Why do you keep interrupting him in the middle of what he is saying."
S1002864,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,She’d never admit it.
S1002866,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I’d be surprised if her attitudes weren’t up-to-date in the right places.
S1002868,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,The tantalising life she leads.
S1002870,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Never a word or a gesture out of place.
S1002873,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,And she’d be the first to admit it.
S1002875,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I think you might have warned us.
S1002877,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Coming here without an attitude and then expecting us to sit by while you make yourself another.
S1002879,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I’m going. I can’t be bothered watching.
S1002883,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,"I suppose he’d better go through with it, though where it’s going to lead is anybody’s guess. Go on. You can’t leave it unfinished. Half an attitude is worse than none."
S1002885,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Well –
S1002893,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Earlier on.
S1002895,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,I don’t know.
S1002901,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,He’s leaving for Damascus after the wedding.

S1003096,P001,C0007,QUEENIE,,Of which I am Maharanee. (Pause.) I love that part. I’m glad we had India.

S1001975,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Quite All right. Quite All right. Won’t you step up here?
S1001977,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"You don’t mind, do you, Madge?"
S1001979,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"If you see him anywhere around, send him out here."
S1001980,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Good. We shall have the place to ourselves. (Pause.) Did you have any trouble finding us?

S1001984,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"And yet, you know, I had to speak to her only last night for missing an entrance."
S1001986,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Not at All.
S1001990,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Quite, quite. (To Fred.) You misjudged an entrance. If you hadn’t come in we would have carried on without you. So your entrance wasn’t necessary."
S1001992,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Later, perhaps. You’d better make the change. We’re freezing out here."
S1001994,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Yes. Her husband. He was a replacement. We had a bit of trouble with the previous one. Frank – that was his name. An unpleasant business.
S1001997,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"It’s All in the day’s work. (Looks at his watch.) Well, now I’ll just give you a rough outline of the story. Madge and Fred have been married for twelve years; during that time they’ve had their ups and downs like any other couple, but on the whole they’ve been happy and contented. They have a delightful daughter called Janice. (Confidentially.) I’m Uncle Bill to young Janice. And I’ll let you into a secret – we’re engaged! She proposed to me in her mummy’s dressing room before the show. Delightful! So naive! And completely unspoiled by success. It hasn’t affected her a jot. Not a jot. She’s still the simple little girl she was before the play opened. (Pause.) Ah, that’s better. Quite a difference. We’re out of that cold wind now. (Unloosens his scarf and takes off his gloves.) Janice’s daddy, Fred, has become obsessed by the idea that his life is being wasted. This threatens to endanger his marriage. Now, you’ve seen, haven’t you, Madge and Fred at home? Next we’ll show you them at work – oh, yes, Madge is a busy modern housewife, does two jobs a day, and so she can’t be expected to put up with her husband in the evening, can she? If you’ll go back to your seat…"
S1001999,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Excellent. Excellent. Then, if you don’t mind we could begin."
S1002001,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Ready for us? It is we who are ready for you. We’re at your service.
S1002087,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"He’s late, isn’t he?"
S1002090,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Like that is it?
S1002092,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,How’s that daughter of yours?
S1002094,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Are you?
S1002096,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Hallo, was this his idea?"
S1002097,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Hm. Did it cost much?
S1002099,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,We must keep up with the times.
S1002101,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Up to date. (Looks at his watch.) He is late.
S1002103,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"We’ll do a few cuts then. (To Madge.) Miss the scene in the park, and the one in the launderette, and the one where Janice gets lost, and the one where Fred threatens to leave you for the first time."
S1002105,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Cut that. Cut the one where Janice has her first exam, and the one where the bats escape, and the one where Queenie brings you and Fred together."
S1002107,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Yes.
S1002198,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,For Heaven’s sake! get on with it! We’ll be here All night.

S1002208,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,The staff problem gets worse.
S1002210,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Good God, yes! We haven’t heard a word from him since Madge got her divorce."
S1002212,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Not too bad, All things considered. He never writes, you know. She got a card one Christmas to say he’d taken a job abroad. (Pause.) Did you ever meet her father?"
S1002214,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"He’s in hospital, not expected to see the year out. (Pause.) And Queenie – you remember her?"
S1002216,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"She married an Indian. There was a lot of talk, I can tell you. She’s going to Sutpura with him. Entering his harem and All that. She signed the papers. (Pause.) And Gladys – she was the one with the glasses – Gladys passed away a couple of years ago. Dropped dead at work. Strained herself everyone said. (Pause.) And that’s All from me. What have you to say for yourself?"
S1002219,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Seen a doctor?
S1002221,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,I hope you’ll be able to give me a hand – a bit of lifting? Good. Here we go again.

S1002295,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"No time like the present. You’ll find Sykes outside, he’ll put you in the picture. (Exit Fred.) I’m having to get rid of Sykes. Drinks like a fish. Can’t leave the stuff alone. Do you know, he spent the best part of five years in a bar? Shocking really."
S1002298,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"Don’t forget the little job you promised to do, will you?"
S1002300,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,He reeks of whisky!
S1002302,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Perhaps you’re right. (Pause.) I’ve brought these for you.

S1002399,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,"I know the man who runs the Sunday papers; I worked for him once. Having heard a rumour or two, I went to see him in his office high above the city. I had a little chat. (Pause.) And I fixed everything. (Pause.) There, what do you say to that?"
S1002400,P001,C0009,WEBBER,,Yes.

S1002468,P001,C0010,Petrie,,I make only one stipulation – the people selected must be pig-headed enough to withstand insult; I won’t have anyone seriously injured.

I’m carried away by the thought of those infantile, nepotic liars, time-serving good taste with as much slobber as a savage his totem or fetish. They are a tumour on the life of the nation, with their intolerable middleness; mediocre, so-so, medium, second-rate; neither fish nor fowl; flat, stale and unprofitable; depressing to the acute and the dull, at loggerheads with lack-wits and men of learning, with shining lights and crack-brains. Not pleasing the one or the other. Cricket-playing, doctrinaire, accepting; stupid, arid, Christians, running mad, amok, berserk, doting, frantic with taste, befooled, infatuate with delicacy and middle-of-the-road decorum. They please no party, faction, side, class, set or crowd, except their own sacred band of jumped-up fairy-godmothers."

Should we tolerate gradual freezing of our anger, watch bitterness and pain drugged into insensibility? Is anger so rare a specific that only the young must have access to it? (Pause.) No! We must hurt the feelings of our enemies, infuriate those we dislike, and never cease to delight in bringing the hornet’s nest about our ears!"

S1002908,P001,C0011,MISS OLDBOURNE,,The vicar.
S1002910,P001,C0011,MISS OLDBOURNE,,"I’ve lost him! Oh, dear, can you ever forgive me?"
S1002912,P001,C0011,MISS OLDBOURNE,,"I was very careful. I notched each beanstalk. I told him to keep close to me. When we got him into the forest, I relaxed a little and tried a mild insult or two. His reactions were unpredictable! He ran away. I thought he’d be here."
S1002914,P001,C0011,MISS OLDBOURNE,,"Would you come and help, Queenie?"
S1002916,P001,C0011,MISS OLDBOURNE,,"You’d better stay and see to your guests. Oh, dear! What a thing to happen."

S1003128,P002,C0015,FAY,,Wake up. Stop dreaming. The cars will be here soon. (She sits) I've bought you a flower.
S1003130,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'm a nice person. One in a million.
S1003132,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes. She wouldn't mind my having them.
S1003134,P002,C0015,FAY,,"It's fluff, not fur."
S1003137,P002,C0015,FAY,,When do you wish me to leave?
S1003139,P002,C0015,FAY,,Impossible. I'm needed at other sickbeds. Complain to the Society if you disagree with the rules.
S1003140,P002,C0015,FAY,,Why not?
S1003142,P002,C0015,FAY,,You must find someone to take Mrs Mcleavy's place. She wasn't perfect.
S1003144,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'll hear none of that. My last husband at sixty came through with flying colours. Three days after our wedding he was performing extraordinary feats.
S1003146,P002,C0015,FAY,,Was she posing as a Catholic?
S1003148,P002,C0015,FAY,,"She had a deceitful nature. That much is clear. We mustn't let it happen again. I'll sort out some well-meaning young woman. Bring her here. Introduce you. I can visualize her – medium height, slim, fair hair. A regular visitor to some place of worship. And an ex-member of the League of Mary."
S1003150,P002,C0015,FAY,,Exactly. (She takes a clothes brush and brushes him down) Realize your potential. Marry at once.
S1003152,P002,C0015,FAY,,The Fraternity of the Little Sisters is on my side. Mother Agnes-Mary feels you're a challenge. She's treating it as a specifically Catholic problem.
S1003154,P002,C0015,FAY,,She has every right to do so.
S1003156,P002,C0015,FAY,,"The Holy Father hasn't given a ruling on the subject and so, as far as I'm concerned, they haven't. Really, I sometimes wonder whether living with that woman hasn't made a free thinker of you. You must marry again after a decent interval of mourning."
S1003158,P002,C0015,FAY,,A fortnight would be long enough to indicate your grief. We must keep abreast of the times.
S1003160,P002,C0015,FAY,,Why is it locked?
S1003162,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Your son is a thorn in my flesh. The contents of his dressing-table are in indictment of his way of life. Not only firearms, but family-planning equipment. A Papal dispensation is needed to dust his room."
S1003172,P002,C0015,FAY,,What excuse do you give?
S1003174,P002,C0015,FAY,,That's exactly what a funeral is meant to do.
S1003176,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'm not in favour of private grief. Show your emotions in public or not at all.
S1003180,P002,C0015,FAY,,I sometimes think your father has a sentimental attachment to roses.
S1003182,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Something suitable, I'm sure."
S1003184,P002,C0015,FAY,,The Vatican would never grant an annulment. Not unless he'd produced a hybrid.

S1003189,P002,C0015,FAY,,"And even the sex you were born into isn't safe from your marauding. Father Mac is popular for the remission of sins, as you know. But clearing up after you is a full-time job. He simply cannot be in the confessional twenty-four hours a day. That's reasonable, isn't it? You do see his point?"
S1003191,P002,C0015,FAY,,What are you going to do about this dreadful state of affairs?
S1003193,P002,C0015,FAY,,That will please the Fathers. Who are you going with?
S1003195,P002,C0015,FAY,,Have you known him long?
S1003197,P002,C0015,FAY,,Was that economy or malpractice?
S1003199,P002,C0015,FAY,,You've confirmed my worst fears. You have no job. No prospects. And now you're about to elope to the Continent with a casual acquaintance and not even a baby as justification. Where will you end? Not respected by the world at large like your father. Most people of any influence will ignore you. You'll be forced to associate with young men like yourself. Does that prospect please you?
S1003201,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Well, hesitation is something to be going on with. We can build on that. What will you do when you're old?"
S1003203,P002,C0015,FAY,,I see you're determined to run the gamut of all experience. That can bring you nothing but unhappiness. You've had every chance to lead a decent life and rejected them. I've no further interest in your career. (She rises to her feet) Call your father. He's surely had enough of the company of plants for the present.
S1003204,P002,C0015,FAY,,Shhh! This is a house of mourning.
S1003207,P002,C0015,FAY,,Rubble?
S1003209,P002,C0015,FAY,,People are so unbalanced these days. The man sitting next to you on the bus could be insane.
S1003212,P002,C0015,FAY,,Do you know the men concerned?
S1003214,P002,C0015,FAY,,You're going away.
S1003216,P002,C0015,FAY,,Where would you go?
S1003218,P002,C0015,FAY,,Where are you going?
S1003220,P002,C0015,FAY,,Is he driving?
S1003222,P002,C0015,FAY,,"The funeral will occupy you for an hour or so. Afterwards a stroll to the house of a man of God, a few words of wisdom and a glance through the Catholic Truth Society’s most recent publication should set your adrenalin flowing. Then a rest. I don't want you overstrained."
S1003224,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'll decide when you've inconvenienced me long enough.
S1003226,P002,C0015,FAY,,As long as you appreciate my desire to help. My own life has been unhappy. I want yours to be different.
S1003228,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes. My husbands died. I've had seven altogether. One a year on average since I was sixteen. I'm extravagant you see. And then I lived under stress near Penzance for some time. I've had trouble with institutions. Lack of funds. A court case with my hairdresser. I've been reduced to asking people for money before now.
S1003230,P002,C0015,FAY,,Not willingly. They had to be persuaded. (With a bright smile) I shall accompany you to your lawyers. After the reading of your wife's will you may need skilled medical assistance.
S1003231,P002,C0015,FAY,,I've also arranged for your doctor to be at your side. You've a weak heart.
S1003233,P002,C0015,FAY,,Harold can carry his mother to the car.
S1003236,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's a necessary part of the process.
S1003238,P002,C0015,FAY,,In the little casket in the hall. Such tranquillity she has. Looks as though she might speak.
S1003239,P002,C0015,FAY,,Death can be very tragic for those who are left.
S1003241,P002,C0015,FAY,,I expect they ran out of materials.
S1003243,P002,C0015,FAY,,"No. (With a smile, to Hal) He's such an innocent, isn't he? Not familiar with the ways of the world."
S1003248,P002,C0015,FAY,,Where did you get the money?
S1003262,P002,C0015,FAY,,"How do you sleep, Harold?"
S1003266,P002,C0015,FAY,,They'd wear old clothes. Burn them after.
S1003338,P002,C0015,FAY,,Here – (she puts the embroidered text on to the coffin) – the Ten Commandments. She was a great believer in some of them.
S1003339,P002,C0015,FAY,,"She's gone. I could feel her presence leaving us. Funny how you know, isn't it?"
S1003341,P002,C0015,FAY,,"It's another piece of your late wife's finery. Some people would censure me for wearing it. (She puts a hand on his arm, smiles) Are you feeling calmer now?"
S1003344,P002,C0015,FAY,,Good afternoon. Who are you?
S1003353,P002,C0015,FAY,,The son of the house.
S1003355,P002,C0015,FAY,,I've already asked for it to be opened. He refused point-blank.
S1003357,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes. I'm attending the funeral of my late employer.
S1003359,P002,C0015,FAY,,The licensee of the King of Denmark. I don't think a publican's tribute should be given pride of place.
S1003361,P002,C0015,FAY,,How do you know?
S1003363,P002,C0015,FAY,, It has a dent to one side and engraved on the back the words ‘St Mary's Convent. Gentiles Only.’ It's not difficult to guess at your background from such tell-tale clues.
S1003364,P002,C0015,FAY,,You're quite correct. It was a prize for good conduct. The dent was an accident.
S1003366,P002,C0015,FAY,,During a quarrel.
S1003370,P002,C0015,FAY,,How did you know it happened at the Hermitage Private Hotel?
S1003372,P002,C0015,FAY,,They didn't!
S1003375,P002,C0015,FAY,,You could say the same of an even moderately successful undertaker.
S1003377,P002,C0015,FAY,,How do you know?
S1003380,P002,C0015,FAY,,You should be a detective.
S1003382,P002,C0015,FAY,,At once. Delay would be fatal.
S1003384,P002,C0015,FAY,,How dare you speak to me like this! Who are you?
S1003386,P002,C0015,FAY,,I can't sign a blank sheet of paper. Someone might forge my name on a cheque.
S1003388,P002,C0015,FAY,,I don't know your name.
S1003390,P002,C0015,FAY,,Will you do one thing for me?
S1003392,P002,C0015,FAY,,Let me see you without your hat.
S1003396,P002,C0015,FAY,,We must watch that he doesn't abuse his trust. He showed no credentials.
S1003403,P002,C0015,FAY,,Mrs Mcleavy was a good mother. She has a right to respect.
S1003405,P002,C0015,FAY,,Have you ever seen Paradise?
S1003407,P002,C0015,FAY,,Who took them?
S1003409,P002,C0015,FAY,,You mustn't run yourself into debt.
S1003411,P002,C0015,FAY,,"I don't know whether you can be trusted with a secret, but it would be wrong of me to keep you in the dark a moment longer. Your wife changed her will shortly before she died. She left all her money to me."
S1003413,P002,C0015,FAY,,Perfectly.
S1003415,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'm surprised at you taking this attitude. Have you no sense of decency?
S1003417,P002,C0015,FAY,,Nineteen thousand pounds including her bonds and her jewels.
S1003419,P002,C0015,FAY,,Except her diamond ring. It's too large and unfashionable for a woman to wear. She's left that to Harold.
S1003421,P002,C0015,FAY,,"You don't imagine that I want the money for myself, do you."
S1003423,P002,C0015,FAY,,That's unworthy of you. I'm most embarrassed by Mrs Mcleavy's generosity.
S1003425,P002,C0015,FAY,,I wish I could.
S1003427,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's a legal document. I could be sued.
S1003429,P002,C0015,FAY,,The beneficiary.
S1003431,P002,C0015,FAY,,I might. If I was pushed too far. We must find some way of conveying the money into your bank account.
S1003433,P002,C0015,FAY,,Think of the scandal.
S1003435,P002,C0015,FAY,,We must have a joint bank account.
S1003437,P002,C0015,FAY,,Not if we were married.
S1003439,P002,C0015,FAY,,That is one way of looking at it.
S1003441,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'm a qualified nurse.
S1003443,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'd do it for you.
S1003445,P002,C0015,FAY,,I ask for nothing. I'm a woman. Only half the human race can say that without fear of contradiction. (She kisses him) Go ahead. Ask me to marry you. I've no intention of refusing. On your knees. I'm a great believer in traditional positions.
S1003447,P002,C0015,FAY,,Exercise is good for them. (Mcleavy kneels) Use any form of proposal you like. Try to avoid abstract nouns.
S1003449,P002,C0015,FAY,,They'll have to wait. Your father is about to propose to me. I think you may stay.
S1003452,P002,C0015,FAY,,And she never will be if you insist on prolonging the proceedings beyond their natural length.
S1003454,P002,C0015,FAY,,I couldn't marry you. You're not a Catholic.
S1003456,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'm not prepared to be both wife and missionary.
S1003457,P002,C0015,FAY,,Has he his bank statement on him?
S1003460,P002,C0015,FAY,,I've decided not to attend. I shall wave. Show my respects from afar.
S1003463,P002,C0015,FAY,,It really doesn't concern me what he grows. Grow two if it pleases him.
S1003465,P002,C0015,FAY,,The income from fairgrounds might interest me. Otherwise a man with two has no more fascination than a man with one.
S1003467,P002,C0015,FAY,,We shall prove you wrong. He'll start a second family under my guidance.
S1003473,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Is that true, Harold?"
S1003478,P002,C0015,FAY,,Blow your nose. People expect it.
S1003480,P002,C0015,FAY,,I've a coatee in there.
S1003482,P002,C0015,FAY,,I bought it three days ago. I must change. Mourning gets so grubby if you hang around in it for long.
S1003484,P002,C0015,FAY,,What?
S1003486,P002,C0015,FAY,,You've added murder to the list of insults heaped upon your family?
S1003488,P002,C0015,FAY,,"You're running a private mortuary, then?"
S1003490,P002,C0015,FAY,,That'd be an unusual hiding-place.
S1003492,P002,C0015,FAY,,Where is it waiting?
S1003494,P002,C0015,FAY,,Open it.
S1003496,P002,C0015,FAY,,I haven't.
S1003498,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes.
S1003500,P002,C0015,FAY,,Your explanation had the ring of truth. Naturally I disbelieved every word.
S1003502,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Oh, no! I couldn't. This is a case for the authorities."
S1003504,P002,C0015,FAY,,I need no help from you to get a man to bed.
S1003506,P002,C0015,FAY,,As a creed it has more to offer than most.
S1003508,P002,C0015,FAY,,Young men pepper their conversation with tales of rape. It creates a good impression.
S1003510,P002,C0015,FAY,,I never point. It's rude.
S1003512,P002,C0015,FAY,,I haven't decided whether I wish to marry your father. Your friend is a more interesting proposition.
S1003515,P002,C0015,FAY,,You intend a country burial?
S1003517,P002,C0015,FAY,,Suppose a dog were to discover her? When they were out hunting for foxes. Do you set no store by the average foxhound?
S1003519,P002,C0015,FAY,,Your mother's underclothes?
S1003521,P002,C0015,FAY,,I couldn't. Our sizes vary.
S1003523,P002,C0015,FAY,,We're nowhere near the river.
S1003525,P002,C0015,FAY,,Provided you pay for the petrol.
S1003527,P002,C0015,FAY,,Where will she be?
S1003529,P002,C0015,FAY,,What about payment?
S1003531,P002,C0015,FAY,,Thirty-three and a third.
S1003533,P002,C0015,FAY,,Is it valuable?
S1003535,P002,C0015,FAY,,I'll add it to my collection. I already have seven by right of conquest.
S1003537,P002,C0015,FAY,,"Thirty-three and a third, the wedding ring and you pay for the petrol."
S1003539,P002,C0015,FAY,,I never bargain.
S1003541,P002,C0015,FAY,,I need help to get her out of the cupboard.
S1003543,P002,C0015,FAY,,What's that?
S1003547,P002,C0015,FAY,,Are you committed to having her teeth removed?
S1003549,P002,C0015,FAY,,No. She bought them out of her winnings. She had some good evenings at the table last year.
S1003553,P002,C0015,FAY,,We decided not to go. We were afraid we might break down.
S1003555,P002,C0015,FAY,,What are you doing here?
S1003560,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's common knowledge what police procedure is. They must have a search warrant.
S1003564,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's empty.
S1003571,P002,C0015,FAY,,What's your name?
S1003573,P002,C0015,FAY,,Your Christian name.
S1003575,P002,C0015,FAY,,Is it Jim?
S1003577,P002,C0015,FAY,,A man at the door says it is.
S1003579,P002,C0015,FAY,,He says his name is Meadows.
S1003581,P002,C0015,FAY,,No. God works for them. They have Him in their pockets like we've always been taught.
S1003583,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's not something I care to reminisce about.
S1003585,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes.
S1003587,P002,C0015,FAY,,What?
S1003593,P002,C0015,FAY,,It's not a mummy. It's a dummy. I used to sew my dresses on it.
S1003595,P002,C0015,FAY,,I call it ‘she’ because of my sewing. The garments were female and because I'm literal-minded I chose to believe I was making them on a lady.
S1003600,P002,C0015,FAY,,To a carnival. She's part of a display.
S1003602,P002,C0015,FAY,,A sewing-class. Prewar. The difference in technique is to be demonstrated.
S1003604,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes.
S1003606,P002,C0015,FAY,,It isn't going now.
S1003608,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes.
S1003612,P002,C0015,FAY,,Yes.
S1003615,P002,C0015,FAY,,Certainly not.

On the third of December last I advertised in the trade papers for a situation. Mr Mcleavy answered my request. He wished me to nurse his wife back to health a task I found impossible to perform. Mrs Mcleavy was dying. Had euthanasia not been against my religion I would have practised it. Instead I decided to murder her. I administered poison during the night of June the twenty-second. In the morning I found her dead and notified the authorities. I have had nothing but heartache ever since. I am sorry for my dreadful crime. (She weeps)

S1003259,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"What a terrible thing to contemplate. The young men, thinking only of the money, burrowing from the undertakers to the bank. The smell of corruption and the instruments of death behind them, the riches before them. They'd do anything for money. They'd risk damnation in this world and the next for it. And me, a good man by any lights, moving among such people. They'll have it on their conscience. Even if they aren't caught, they'll suffer."
S1003261,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"I don't know. But such people never benefit from their crimes. It's people like myself who have the easy time. Asleep at nights. Despite appearances to the contrary, criminals are poor sleepers."
S1003265,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"What clothes would they wear, d'you suppose? Dust is easily identified. They'd surely not work in the nude? God have mercy on them if they did. Even to avoid the hangman I'd not put up with precautions of that nature."
S1003267,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"If you could get a glance between their toes you'd find the evidence. But to order a man to remove his clothes isn't within the power of the police. More's the pity, I say. I'd like to see them given wider powers. They're hamstrung by red tape. They're a fine body of men. Doing their job under impossible conditions."
S1003269,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"If you ever possess their kindness, courtesy and devotion to duty, I'll lift my hat to you."

S1003414,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,She must've been drunk. What about me and the boy?

S1003418,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Her jewels as well?
S1003420,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Employing you has cost me a fortune. You must be the most expensive nurse in history.

S1003434,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,What do you suggest then?
S1003436,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Wouldn't that cause an even bigger scandal?

S1003440,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,No. I'm too old. My health wouldn't stand up to a young wife.
S1003442,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,You'd have to give up your career.

S1003461,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,The number of people staying away from the poor woman's funeral is heartbreaking. And I hired a de luxe model car because they're roomier. I could've saved myself the expense.

In spite of this I kept a tight hold on my emotions, refusing to show the extent of my loss. Along the route perfect strangers had the courtesy to raise their hats. We got admiring glances for the flowers and sympathetic nods for me."
S1003666,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"No. Mr Walter Tracey. The hearse was a wreck within seconds. Meanwhile the second part of the cortège crashed into the smoking wreckage. I was flung to one side, hitting my head on the bodywork of the vehicle. The next thing I knew I was being helped out by passers-by. The road looked like a battlefield. Strewn with the injured and dying. Blood, glass."

S1003670,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,No. People remarked on the extreme durability of the lid. I was about to give the undertaker a recommendation. Then I remembered that he wasn't capable of receiving one.

S1003951,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,What's more serious than mass murder?
S1003953,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Harold would never do a thing like that. He belongs to the Sons of Divine Providence.
S1003956,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'm not sure that it is an eye. I think it's a marble which has been trod on.
S1003968,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,One moment. (To Truscott) Let me see that eye.
S1003972,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Of what?
S1003974,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"It must've been a very special occasion if she gave you her eye to mark it. Come along, I'm not the police. I want a sensible answer. Who gave it to you?"
S1003977,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,This is stolen property. This eye belongs to my wife.
S1003979,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,My wife had glass eyes.
S1003981,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,None.
S1003983,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,These were fitted after death. Her own were taken away.
S1003985,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I don't know.
S1003987,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,No.
S1003989,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Oh, Inspector – (Brokenly) – my son, you heard him confess it, has stolen the eyes from the dead; a practice unknown outside of medical science. I have reared a ghoul at my own expense."
S1003991,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Fetch a screwdriver. The coffin must be opened. I want to know what else thievery stoops to. Her head may have gone as well.
S1003994,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Fetch a screwdriver.
S1003996,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I can't ask the priest to hold the burial service over an eye. Fetch a screwdriver.
S1003998,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'm not interested in doing good. There are organizations devoted to that purpose. Fetch a screwdriver! Do I have to repeat it like the muezzin?
S1004000,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,She's my wife. I can do what I like with her. Anything is legal with a corpse.
S1004004,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,My duty is clear.
S1004008,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Where? (Bewildered) Where? (He follows Hal’s glance to the corpse and recoils in horror) Oh, the end of the world is near when such crimes are committed."
S1004011,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'm sorry I ever got you. I'd've withheld myself at the conception if I'd known.
S1004013,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Where did I go wrong? His upbringing was faultless. (To Dennis) Did you lead him astray?
S1004017,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I loved her.
S1004020,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Oh, wicked, wicked. (Wildly) These hairs – (Points) – they're grey. You made them so. I'd be a redhead today had you been an accountant."
S1004021,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"I'm sorry, Inspector. My behaviour must seem strange to you. I'll endeavour to explain it. You can then do as you think fit."
S1004024,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I wish to prefer charges.
S1004026,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I– I– (Sweating) I've given misleading information to the police.
S1004028,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"I told you that the eye belonged to my wife. It doesn't. (Conscience stricken) Oh, God forgive me for what I'm doing."
S1004032,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,But – the bank robbery – is the case closed?
S1004034,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Oh, dear, what a nuisance. And in a house of mourning, too."
S1004038,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Isn't there anything I can do to prevent this appalling assault upon my privacy?
S1004041,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Oh, what a terrible thing I've done. I've obstructed an officer in the course of his duty."
S1004042,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I shan't be able to face my reflection in the mirror.
S1004045,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'll say nothing of what I've discovered if you return the money to the bank. You're not to keep a penny of it. Do you understand?
S1004047,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'll go and ring Father Jellicoe. My soul is in torment.
S1004068,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,You're back already? Have you decided to arrest me after all?
S1004072,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Yes.
S1004074,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Yes.
S1004076,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Well no. I'm not a member myself.
S1004078,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Oh, yes. They met a couple of times a week. They do a lot of good for the country. Raising money for charities, holding fetes. The old folk would be lost without them."
S1004081,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,My wife never took her clothes off in public in her life.
S1004083,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,What condition?
S1004090,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"Well, Inspector, you've found the money and unmasked the criminals. You must do your duty and arrest them. I shall do mine and appear as witness for the prosecution."
S1004107,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Has no one considered my feelings in all this?
S1004109,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I don't want money. I'm an honest man.
S1004111,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I shall denounce the lot of you!
S1004113,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,What kind of talk is that? You don't make sense.
S1004115,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I'll go to the priest. He makes sense. He makes sense to me.
S1004117,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"If I can't trust the police, I can still rely on the Fathers. They'll advise me what to do!"
S1004142,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,What am I charged with?
S1004144,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,You can't do this. I've always been a law-abiding citizen. The police are for the protection of ordinary people.
S1004146,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,I want to see someone in authority.
S1004148,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,Someone higher.
S1004150,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,You're mad!
S1004152,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"I'm innocent. (A little unsure of himself, the beginnings of panic) Doesn't that mean anything to you?"
S1004154,P002,C0016,MCLEAVY,,"I'm innocent! I'm innocent! (At the door, pause, a last wail) Oh, what a terrible thing to happen to a man who's been kissed by the Pope."
S1003164,P002,C0018,HAL,,I've personal property in there.
S1003166,P002,C0018,HAL,,I can't. You wouldn't wish to see. It's a present for your anniversary.
S1003168,P002,C0018,HAL,,Your being made a knight of the Order of St Gregory.
S1003170,P002,C0018,HAL,,No.
S1003171,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003173,P002,C0018,HAL,,It would upset me.
S1003178,P002,C0018,HAL,,Roses and fern.
S1003181,P002,C0018,HAL,,Do you know what his only comment was on my mother's death?
S1003183,P002,C0018,HAL,,"He said he was glad she'd died at the right season for roses. He's been up half the night cataloguing the varieties on the crosses. You should've seen him when that harp arrived. Sniffing the petals, checking, arguing with the man who brought it. They almost came to blows over the pronunciation."
S1003186,P002,C0018,HAL,,"Yes, the egg I presented to her went untouched."
S1003188,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003190,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003192,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm going abroad.
S1003194,P002,C0018,HAL,,A mate of mine. Dennis. A very luxurious type of lad. At present employed by an undertaker. And doing well in the profession.
S1003196,P002,C0018,HAL,,We shared the same cradle.
S1003198,P002,C0018,HAL,,"We were too young then to practise, and economics still defeat us."
S1003200,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm not sure.
S1003202,P002,C0018,HAL,,I shall die.
S1003211,P002,C0018,HAL,,What do you known of the big gangs? It's a small gang. Minute.
S1003213,P002,C0018,HAL,,"If I had that money, I wouldn't be here. I'd go away."
S1003215,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'd go away quicker.
S1003217,P002,C0018,HAL,,Spain. The playground of international crime.
S1003219,P002,C0018,HAL,,Portugal.
S1003221,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes. He looks impressive. Close proximity to death obviously agrees with him.
S1003235,P002,C0018,HAL,,"She's minus her vital organs, isn't she?"
S1003240,P002,C0018,HAL,,"Here, her eyes are blue. Mum's eyes were brown. That's a bit silly, isn't it?"
S1003263,P002,C0018,HAL,,Alone.
S1003268,P002,C0018,HAL,,"The police are a lot of idle buffoons, Dad. As you well know."
S1003272,P002,C0018,HAL,,It won't lock.
S1003274,P002,C0018,HAL,,When?
S1003276,P002,C0018,HAL,,Was my name mentioned?
S1003278,P002,C0018,HAL,,How long?
S1003280,P002,C0018,HAL,,Ladies’ overcoats.
S1003282,P002,C0018,HAL,,"Don't go on, baby. I remember the humiliating circumstances of failure."
S1003284,P002,C0018,HAL,,"I can't, baby. It's against my nature."
S1003286,P002,C0018,HAL,,Why not?
S1003288,P002,C0018,HAL,,It's crossed mine.
S1003289,P002,C0018,HAL,,I should thank anybody for that?
S1003291,P002,C0018,HAL,,Think what's at stake.
S1003293,P002,C0018,HAL,,She's embalmed. Good for centuries.
S1003296,P002,C0018,HAL,,We're creating a precedent. Into the cupboard. Come on.
S1003298,P002,C0018,HAL,,Bury it. In a mineshaft. Out in the country. Or in the marshes. Weigh the corpse with rock.
S1003301,P002,C0018,HAL,,Bury her naked? My own mum?
S1003302,P002,C0018,HAL,,Aren't we committing some kind of unforgivable sin?
S1003305,P002,C0018,HAL,,"That's typical of your upbringing, baby. Every luxury was lavished on you – atheism, breast-feeding, circumcision. I had to make my own way."
S1003307,P002,C0018,HAL,,O.K. And afterwards we'll go to a smashing brothel I've just discovered. Run by a woman who was connected with the Royal Family one time. Very ugly bird. Part Polish. Her eyes look that way. Nice line in crumpet she has. (He sits astride the coffin)
S1003309,P002,C0018,HAL,,Why not?
S1003311,P002,C0018,HAL,,Have you anyone in mind?
S1003313,P002,C0018,HAL,,She's older than you.
S1003315,P002,C0018,HAL,,She's three parts Papal nuncio. She'd only do it at set times.
S1003317,P002,C0018,HAL,,You've had her? (Dennis grins) Knocked it off? Really?
S1003319,P002,C0018,HAL,,In her room. Often.
S1003321,P002,C0018,HAL,,"I don't like your living for kicks, baby. Put these neurotic ideas out of your mind and concentrate on the problems of everyday life. We must get the corpse buried before tonight. Be in a tricky position else. And another stretch will be death to my ambitions. I put my not getting on in life down to them persistently sending me to Borstal. I might go permanently bent if this falls through. It's not a pleasant prospect, is it?"
S1003323,P002,C0018,HAL,,"Yes, he has a nice line in corporal punishment. Last time he was here he kicked my old lady’s cat and he smiled while he did it. How did he get into your house?"
S1003325,P002,C0018,HAL,,Did you tell him?
S1003327,P002,C0018,HAL,,What did he say?
S1003329,P002,C0018,HAL,,You should've phoned the police. Asked for protection.
S1003331,P002,C0018,HAL,,What did they say?
S1003333,P002,C0018,HAL,,What did Truscott say?
S1003335,P002,C0018,HAL,,"That brothel I mentioned has swing doors. (He bows his head) You don't often see that, do you?"
S1003398,P002,C0018,HAL,,There's a delay in starting the car. A flat tyre.(Taking off his coat) We're changing the wheel.
S1003400,P002,C0018,HAL,,Dennis is guarding the coffin.
S1003402,P002,C0018,HAL,,The contents of that coffin are very precious to me. I'm determined to see they get to the graveyard without mishap.
S1003448,P002,C0018,HAL,,We're ready. The leader of the Mother's Union has given the signal for tears. (He picks up his coat) We must ride the tide of emotion while it lasts.
S1003450,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm surprised he should wish to marry again. He couldn't do justice to his last wife.
S1003462,P002,C0018,HAL,,He'd grow a moustache.
S1003464,P002,C0018,HAL,,Would it please you? That's the point.
S1003468,P002,C0018,HAL,,You're wasting your time. He couldn't propagate a row of tomatoes.
S1003469,P002,C0018,HAL,,"She doesn't know what she's missing, baby."
S1003471,P002,C0018,HAL,,You're driving the car. People will notice your absence.
S1003476,P002,C0018,HAL,,"I can't, baby. It's my upbringing."
S1003479,P002,C0018,HAL,,Why are you so interested?
S1003481,P002,C0018,HAL,,Really?
S1003483,P002,C0018,HAL,,I've got something in there.
S1003485,P002,C0018,HAL,,A corpse.
S1003487,P002,C0018,HAL,,One doesn't have to murder to acquire a corpse.
S1003489,P002,C0018,HAL,,In my mother's coffin.
S1003491,P002,C0018,HAL,,The money is putting on incorruption. The flesh is still waiting.
S1003493,P002,C0018,HAL,,In that cupboard.
S1003495,P002,C0018,HAL,,You have a key.
S1003497,P002,C0018,HAL,,You were lying?
S1003499,P002,C0018,HAL,,I concealed nothing from you.
S1003501,P002,C0018,HAL,,I want her buried. Are you prepared to help me?
S1003503,P002,C0018,HAL,,You'll never make it to the altar without my help.
S1003505,P002,C0018,HAL,,My father holds it as a cherished belief that a whore is no fit companion for a man.
S1003507,P002,C0018,HAL,,My mate Dennis has done you. He speaks of it with relish.
S1003509,P002,C0018,HAL,,"You never had the blessing of a rape. I was with him at his only ravishment. A bird called Pauline Ching. Broke a tooth in the struggle, she did. It was legal with you. While Jesus pointed to his Sacred Heart, you pointed to yours."
S1003511,P002,C0018,HAL,,"If I tell my father, he'll never marry you."
S1003513,P002,C0018,HAL,,He won't be if you grass to the police.
S1003514,P002,C0018,HAL,,"I want the body stripped. All I ask is an hour or two of Burke and Hare. It isn't a thing someone of the opposite sex can do. And I'm a relative, which complicates the issue."
S1003516,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003518,P002,C0018,HAL,,Perfectly preserved body of a woman. No sign of foul play. The uniform we'll burn. The underwear you can keep.
S1003520,P002,C0018,HAL,,All good stuff.
S1003522,P002,C0018,HAL,,For the bonfire then. Her teeth can go in the river.
S1003524,P002,C0018,HAL,,We can borrow your car.
S1003526,P002,C0018,HAL,,Right.
S1003528,P002,C0018,HAL,,In the back seat. (He puts the comb away) She always was a back-seat driver.
S1003530,P002,C0018,HAL,,Twenty per cent.
S1003532,P002,C0018,HAL,,You can keep her wedding ring.
S1003534,P002,C0018,HAL,,Very.
S1003536,P002,C0018,HAL,,"Twenty per cent, the wedding ring and I pay for the petrol?"
S1003538,P002,C0018,HAL,,You drive a hard bargain.
S1003540,P002,C0018,HAL,,Done.
S1003542,P002,C0018,HAL,,She won't bite. You have your gloves on.
S1003544,P002,C0018,HAL,,Was it the wedding ring?
S1003545,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm inclined to agree.
S1003546,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'd like to run a brothel. (He pushes the stockings into the shoes) I'd run a two-star brothel. And if I prospered I'd graduate to a three-star brothel. I'd advertise ‘By Appointment’. Like jam.
S1003548,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003551,P002,C0018,HAL,,Nothing.
S1003556,P002,C0018,HAL,,Have you a search warrant?
S1003558,P002,C0018,HAL,,To search the house.
S1003562,P002,C0018,HAL,,It isn't locked.
S1003566,P002,C0018,HAL,,He's a mate of mine.
S1003568,P002,C0018,HAL,,Anyone can make a mistake.
S1003570,P002,C0018,HAL,,On crowded dance floors during the rhumba.
S1003580,P002,C0018,HAL,,It's bluff.
S1003582,P002,C0018,HAL,,We've got to get rid of him. He'll find the body next.
S1003584,P002,C0018,HAL,,Something dropped out? We couldn't find it?
S1003586,P002,C0018,HAL,,I know what it was.
S1003588,P002,C0018,HAL,,One of her eyes!
S1003589,P002,C0018,HAL,,Mine.
S1003591,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm an only child.
S1003597,P002,C0018,HAL,,No actual evidence of sex can be given. It's contrary to English law.
S1003599,P002,C0018,HAL,,We were taking it in the car.
S1003610,P002,C0018,HAL,,My mate Dennis was to have arranged transport. He let us down.
S1003616,P002,C0018,HAL,,Sleeping.
S1003618,P002,C0018,HAL,,He was in bed as well.
S1003620,P002,C0018,HAL,,I expect he was.
S1003621,P002,C0018,HAL,,"He's clever. I'm stupid, see."
S1003623,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm a stupid person. That's what I'm trying to say.
S1003625,P002,C0018,HAL,,I can't.
S1003627,P002,C0018,HAL,,I am. I had a hand in the bank job.
S1003630,P002,C0018,HAL,,To prove I'm stupid.
S1003632,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003639,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.
S1003641,P002,C0018,HAL,,By now I'd say it was half-way up the aisle of the Church of St Barnabas and St Jude.
S1003643,P002,C0018,HAL,,I'm telling the truth.
S1003645,P002,C0018,HAL,,Yes.

S1003651,P002,C0018,HAL,,I've told you. In church. They're quoting St Paul over it.
S1003665,P002,C0018,HAL,,Not Dennis!
S1003667,P002,C0018,HAL,,Was the actual fabric of the coffin damaged?
S1003669,P002,C0018,HAL,,No dents? No holes?
S1003686,P002,C0018,HAL,,What are we going to do for the replay?
S1003688,P002,C0018,HAL,,We need a finishing touch. Know what it is? A holy image. Centre. Between candles.
S1003689,P002,C0018,HAL,,"What could be better? Make a gesture. She knew what disappointment was, didn't she? Same as us. A little imagination. What wonders can't it accomplish."
S1003710,P002,C0018,HAL,,You're a responsible person. You could accompany him.
S1003717,P002,C0018,HAL,,We can't rely on him having heard that.
S1003719,P002,C0018,HAL,,Everything.

Your fourth took an overdose on the eve of his retirement from Sadler's Wells. Your fifth and sixth husbands disappeared. Presumed dead. Your last partner suffered a seizure three nights after marrying you. From what cause?

There's something seriously wrong with your approach to marriage. I find it frightening that, undeterred by past experience, you're contemplating an eighth engagement."
S1003378,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You wear another woman's dress as though you were born to it.
S1003379,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Elementary detection. The zip is of a type worn by elderly women.

S1003552,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You admit it? You must be very sure of yourself. Why aren't you both at the funeral? I thought you were mourners.
S1003554,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"That's a selfish attitude to take. The dead can't bury themselves, you know."
S1003557,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What for?
S1003559,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,But I've already searched the house. I don't want to do it again.

S1003563,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I can't take your word for it, lad."
S1003565,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Exactly. There's still a lot of routine work to be done, I can see that. Would you mind waiting outside, miss? I'd like a word with this lad alone. I'll let you know when you're wanted."
S1003567,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You don't want to spend your time with a youth like him. He's not your type. He's got five pregnancies to his credit.
S1003569,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Maybe. But he's obviously getting into the habit of making mistakes. Where does he engender these unwanted children? There are no open spaces. The police patrol regularly. It should be next to impossible to commit the smallest act of indecency, let alone beget a child. Where does he do it?"
S1003572,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I prefer to remain anonymous for the present.
S1003574,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not a practising Christian.
S1003576,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,No.
S1003578,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I'd like to help him, but I'm not prepared to admit to any name other than my own."
S1003590,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Whose was it before?
S1003592,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,A word of warning. Don't take the mickey. You'll make me angry. (He smiles) O.K.?
S1003594,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What sex is it?
S1003596,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Splendid. Excellently put.
S1003598,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Yes, a tailor's dummy provided with evidence of sex would fill the mind of the average magistrate with misgiving. Why is it wrapped?"
S1003601,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What part?
S1003603,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Is this dummy a frequent visitor to exhibitions?
S1003605,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,When is the object's outing to take place?
S1003607,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,The treat has been cancelled?
S1003609,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why?
S1003611,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I can believe that. From all I've heard of your friend I'd say he was quite capable of disappointing a tailor's dummy.
S1003613,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Sounds a reasonable explanation. Quite reasonable.
S1003614,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Can you confirm that, miss?"
S1003617,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Do you seriously expect me to believe that? A man of your age behaving like a child? What was your mate doing on Saturday night?
S1003619,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You'll tell me next he was sleeping.
S1003622,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why do you make such stupid remarks?
S1003624,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What proof have I that you're stupid. Give me an example of your stupidity.
S1003626,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why not? I don't believe you're stupid at all.
S1003629,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,But he is stupid. He's just admitted it. He must be the stupidest criminal in England. Unless – (He regards Hal with mounting suspicion) – unless he's the cleverest. What was your motive in confessing to the bank job?
S1003631,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,But you've proved the opposite.
S1003634,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,They can in certain circumstances.
S1003636,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not prepared to reveal the inner secrets of the water board to a member of the general public. (To Hal) Where's the money?
S1003637,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Who's burying it?
S1003638,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Come here! Come here!
S1003640,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,All right then. As long as we know.
S1003642,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I'm not impressed by his sex, miss. (To Hal) I asked for the truth."
S1003644,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Understand this, lad. You can't get away with cheek. Kids nowadays treat any kind of authority as a challenge. We'll challenge you. If you oppose me in my duty, I'll kick those teeth through the back of your head. Is that clear?"
S1003648,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Don't lie to me!
S1003650,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Where's the money?
S1003652,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I don't care if they're quoting the Highway Code over it. One more chance. Where is it?
S1003653,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'll hose you down! I'll chlorinate you!
S1003656,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Has this happened before?
S1003658,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"If he's going to make a habit of it he ought to learn a sign language. (To Mcleavy) Do you understand me, sir?"
S1003659,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"What has happened, sir?"
S1003661,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I shall have to make a full report.
S1003663,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"That needn't concern you at present, sir. I shall let you know later. Now give me a full statement."
S1003671,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Surely he understood when he took on the job that he couldn't make capital out of his own death?
S1003674,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,By all means. We mustn't keep a lady waiting.
S1003676,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Did you take the owner's name?
S1003678,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,It all seems highly irregular. The dog will have to be destroyed.
S1003680,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I've been frightened myself on occasions. I've never bitten anyone. These people should learn to control their pets.
S1003682,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,She sounds an unstable kind of person to me.
S1003693,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I must ask you to remain where you are. No one is to leave without my permission.
S1003695,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"When you disobey my orders, sir, you make my job doubly difficult."
S1003697,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You'd be considerably happier if you allowed me to do my duty without asking questions.
S1003699,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I'm an official of the Metropolitan Water Board, sir, as I've already told you."
S1003701,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Not if the citizens are law abiding.
S1003703,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I don't propose to argue hypothetical cases with you, sir. Remain where you are till further notice."
S1003705,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That is as may be. I've no power to prevent you.
S1003707,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I can't allow you to do that. It would be contrary to regulations. We've no case against you.
S1003709,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Only if some responsible person accompanies him.
S1003711,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What proof have I that I'm a responsible person?
S1003713,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"That is perfectly correct. In which case I shall accompany you, sir. Come with me."
S1003737,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You'll find a policeman outside. He will accompany you. Off you go.
S1003740,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm nervous as well. I'll be company for him —
S1003742,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,He'll have to come to terms with his psychological peculiarity. Out you go!
S1003744,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What for?
S1003746,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"The theft of an article of clothing is excusable. But policemen, like red squirrels, must be protected. You were rightly convicted. What do you know of paternity orders?"
S1003748,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Don't try to evade the issue. How many women have you made pregnant?
S1003750,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You scatter your seed along the pavements without regard to age or sex. (He taps the corpse) What are you doing with this? Have you taken up sewing?
S1003752,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why?
S1003754,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. I've been told the whole pathetic story. You ought to be ashamed of yourself
S1003755,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I wish you were. Unfortunately what you've done isn't illegal.
S1003756,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,There never was any law.
S1003758,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What for?
S1003760,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That is against the law.
S1003762,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,It still is.
S1003764,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Who told you that?
S1003766,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,When?
S1003768,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You talk like a judge.
S1003770,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not impressed by your fine friends.
S1003772,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Where's it buried?
S1003774,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Your mate says it's been buried.
S1003775,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,A very intelligent reply. You're an honest lad. (He smiles and puts an arm around Dennis’s shoulders) Are you prepared to co-operate with me? I'll see you're all right.
S1003776,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not a policeman.
S1003778,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,No. I'm from the Metropolitan Water Board.
S1003780,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I don't remember doing so.
S1003782,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What were you doing down the station?
S1003783,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What were you suspected of?
S1003785,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,And you complain you were beaten?
S1003787,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Did you tell anyone?
S1003789,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Who?
S1003791,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What did he say?
S1003793,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why not?
S1003795,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I hope you're prepared to substantiate these accusations, lad. What evidence have you?"
S1003797,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What is the official version of those?
S1003799,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I can see nothing unreasonable in that. You want to watch yourself. Making unfounded allegations. You'll find yourself in serious trouble.
S1003802,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,My men did.
S1003803,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I've disconnected the telephone.
S1003805,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You always begin your sentences with ‘Why?’ Did they teach you to at school?
S1003807,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I'm not in a position to say, sir."
S1003809,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Less of that. I must ask you to respect my cloth.
S1003811,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,My name is Truscott.
S1003813,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I've warned you already about leaving this room. Do as you're told or take the consequences.
S1003815,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I can't allow you to do that.
S1003817,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I must disagree. I'm acting under orders.
S1003819,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,My superior officer's.
S1003821,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"If you don't control yourself, I shall have to caution you."
S1003823,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"If you'll give me your undivided attention for a few moments, sir, I promise you we'll have this whole case sorted out. It isn't a game we're playing. It's my duty, and I must do it to the best of my ability."
S1003825,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why? Did it need the air?
S1003827,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,This isn't the garage. What do you mean by bringing it back into this room?
S1003829,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm sure he has no particular aversion to sharing a garage with a tailor's dummy.
S1003831,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What possible objection could there be to an officer undressing a dummy?
S1003835,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Why?
S1003837,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Has its value increased during the last few minutes?
S1003839,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"If it's your usual custom to encourage young men to run up and down garden paths with tailor's dummies, you must be stopped from exercising such arbitrary power."
S1003841,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Really, miss, your relationship with that object verges on the criminal. Has no one in this house any normal feelings? I've never come across such people. If there's any more of it, I shall arrest the lot of you."
S1003843,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You must have realized by now, sir, that I am not from the water board?"
S1003845,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Any deception I practised was never intended to deceive you, sir. You are – if I may say so – an intelligent man. (He laughs to himself) You saw through my disguise at once. It was merely a ruse to give me time to review the situation. To get my bearings on a very tricky assignment. Or two tricky assignments. As you will shortly realize. (He smiles and bows to Mcleavy) You have before you a man who is quite a personage in his way – Truscott of the Yard. Have you never heard of Truscott? The man who tracked down the limbless girl killer? Or was that sensation before your time?"
S1003847,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,She was the killer.
S1003849,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not prepared to answer that question to anyone outside the profession. We don't want a carbon-copy murder on our hands. (To Mcleavy) Do you realize what I'm doing here?
S1003851,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"That is as it should be. The process by which the police arrive at the solution to a mystery is, in itself, a mystery. We've reason to believe that a number of crimes have been committed under your roof. There was no legal excuse for a warrant. We had no proof. However, the water board doesn't need a warrant to enter private houses. And so I availed myself of this loophole in the law. It's for your own good that Authority behaves in this seemingly alarming way. (With a smile) Does my explanation satisfy you?"
S1003853,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Good. I shall proceed to bring the crimes to light. Beginning with the least important.
S1003855,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Murder.
S1003856,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Yes, murder. (To Mcleavy) Your wife passed away three days ago? What did she die of?"
S1003858,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Reading isn't an occupation we encourage among police officers. We try to keep the paper work down to a minimum. (To Mcleavy) Have you no grumble at the way your wife died?
S1003860,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You're easily satisfied, I see. I am not."
S1003862,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,So I understand. But he'd just come from diagnosing a most unusual pregnancy. His mind was so occupied by the nature of the case that he omitted to take all factors into consideration and signed in a fuzz of scientific disbelief. Has anyone seen Mrs Mcleavy since she died?
S1003864,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Can all of you swear you've had no commerce with the dead?
S1003866,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That's a pity. It would have considerably simplified my task if you had been.
S1003868,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Was her fate discussed?
S1003875,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Was anyone with her at the end?(To Hal) Were you?
S1003877,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Was she uneasy? Did she leave no last message?
S1003879,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Was this her usual custom?
S1003881,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Not to the best of your knowledge. Though I've no doubt our information isn't as up to date as we supposed. Did she whisper no last words? As you bent to kiss her cheek before she expired?
S1003883,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Which?
S1003885,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Was it a metaphor?
S1003887,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Apart from Bibles, which are notorious for broken bindings, there is this – The Trial of Phyllis McMahon. Nurse accused of murdering her patient."
S1003889,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Yes, most unflattering, isn't it? They always choose the worst. I cannot get them to print a decent picture."
S1003891,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Unfortunately not. Someone has torn every picture of the nurse from the book.
S1003892,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Unfortunately not. Someone has torn every picture of the nurse from the book.
Once again he turns his piercing gaze upon Fay; she looks uncomfortable
However, we have something equally damning – the handwriting of the accused.
He opens the book at a page of handwriting
And here – (Triumphantly he takes a sheet of paper from his pocket) – the evidence on which I propose to convict: a recent specimen of the handwriting of your late wife's nurse. Identical in every respect."
S1003893,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,One of her many aliases.
S1003895,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Two very simple reasons. I conduct my cases under an assumed voice and I am a master of disguise. (He takes off his hat) You see – a complete transformation. (To Mcleavy) You've had a lucky escape, sir. You'd've been the victim of a murder bid inside a month. We've had the tabs on her for years. Thirteen fatal accidents, two cases of suspected fish poisoning. One unexplained disappearance. She's practised her own form of genocide for a decade and called it nursing."
S1003896,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,At the George V hospital in Holyhead eighty-seven people died within a week. How do you explain that?
S1003898,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"They had a right to live, same as anybody else."
S1003900,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,How many innocents did you massacre – Phyllis?
S1003902,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I fail to see why you choose to cloak the episode in mystery. You can't escape.
S1003904,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,We can't accept the evidence of a ghost. The problems posed would be insuperable.
S1003906,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You know nothing of the law. I know nothing of the law. That makes us equal in the sight of the law.
S1003908,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Who's been filling your head with that rubbish?
S1003910,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,When I make out my report I shall say that you've given me a confession. It could prejudice your case if I have to forge one.
S1003912,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Perjury is a serious crime.
S1003914,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,We have a saying under the blue lamp ‘Waste time on the truth and you'll be pounding the beat until the day you retire.’
S1003915,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That is a mistake which has been rectified. Come along now. I can't stand here all day.
S1003926,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"We're ready when you are, McMahon."
S1003929,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"They'd certainly do more good in Holloway than you will. Take her away, Meadows."
S1003931,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"It's a delicate subject, sir, but for the post-mortem we shall want Mrs Mcleavy's stomach. Where are you keeping it?"
S1003933,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Where is it?
S1003935,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Fetch it, will you?"
S1003939,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What an amazing woman McMahon is. She's got away with it again. She must have influence with Heaven.
S1003941,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Call her back! Look sharp! She'll sue us for wrongful arrest.
S1003942,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Briefly, sir, without your wife's stomach we have no evidence on which to convict."
S1003944,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Even God can't work miracles, sir."
S1003946,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm not paid to quarrel with accepted facts.
S1003948,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,There's no need to be vindictive. Show a little tolerance.
S1003950,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I'm afraid so, sir. However, I've an ace up my sleeve The situation for law and order, though difficult, is by no means hopeless. There's still a chance, albeit a slim one, that I can get McMahon as accessory to another crime. And one which the law regards as far more serious than the taking of human life."
S1003952,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Stealing public money. And that is just what your son and his accomplices have done.
S1003954,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"That may make a difference to Divine Providence, but it cuts no ice with me."
S1003955,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,No. Not a marble. (He regards Mcleavy calmly) It looks suspiciously to me like an eye. The question I'd like answered is – to whom does it legally belong?
S1003957,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"It's an eye, sir. (He takes the eye from Mcleavy) The makers’ name is clearly marked:J. & S. Frazer, Eye-makers to the Profession."
S1003959,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That's a strange bequest for a father to make.
S1003961,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You're a clever woman, McMahon. Unfortunately you're not quite clever enough. I'm no fool."
S1003963,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I've a shrewd suspicion where this eye came from. (He smiles) You know too, don't you?"
S1003965,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Don't lie to me! It's from your sewing dummy, isn't it?"
S1003966,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm glad you've decided to tell the truth at last. We must return the eye to its rightful owner. Unwrap the dummy.
S1003970,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Nothing ever convinces me. I choose the least unlikely explanation and file it in our records.
S1003976,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"We're open to serious discussion, sir, but not bad language."
S1003978,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,On what do you base your assumption?
S1003980,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"A remarkable woman, sir. How many were in her possession at the time of her death?"
S1003982,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I see.
S1003984,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Where to?
S1003986,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Did you never think to inquire?
S1003988,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You act in a singularly heartless manner for someone who claims to have been happily married.
S1003990,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"What do you wish me to do, sir?"
S1003997,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"What good will it do, sir?"
S1003999,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,This is unwarranted interference with the rights of the dead. As a policeman I must ask you to consider your actions most carefully.
S1004001,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Indeed it is not. Conjugal rights should stop with the last heartbeat. I thought you knew that.
S1004003,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Your son seems to have a more balanced idea of the world in which we live than you do, sir."
S1004005,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Only the authorities can decide when your duty is clear Wild guesses by persons like yourself can only cause confusion.
S1004009,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"The opening of a coffin couldn't possibly herald Armageddon. Pull yourself together, sir."
S1004010,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,He was warned in advance of the consequences of his action.
S1004012,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Such idle fantasies ill become you, sir."
S1004025,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Whom do you wish to charge, sir?"
S1004027,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What information?
S1004029,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"If the eye doesn't belong to your wife, to whom does it belong?"
S1004030,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I ought to have my head examined, getting mixed up in a case of this kind. (To Mcleavy) Your conduct is scandalous, sir. With you for a father this lad never stood a chance. No wonder he took to robbing banks."
S1004031,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Do? I'm going to leave this house at once. I've never come across such people. You behave as though you're affiliated to Bedlam.
S1004033,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"No, sir, it's not closed. We don't give up as easily as that. I'm going to have this place turned upside down."
S1004035,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Your wife won't be here, sir. I shall take possession of the remains."
S1004037,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"There's no cause for alarm. It's a mere formality. You're quite safe. (He smiles. To Mcleavy) There's no one more touchy than your hardened criminal. (He puts his pipe away) I'll be back in ten minutes. And then, I'm afraid, a lot of damage will be done to your property. You'll be paying repair bills for months to come. One unfortunate suspect recently had the roof taken off his house."
S1004039,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Well, sir, if you can suggest a possible hiding-place for the money?"
S1004040,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Very well. You must take the consequences of ignorance. (He tips his hat) I'll be back soon.
S1004062,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I've fixed everything to my satisfaction. My men will be here shortly. They're perfectly capable of causing damage unsupervised, and so I shall take my leave of you. (He bows, smiles)"
S1004063,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Good-bye. (He nods to Hal and Dennis) I'd better take the little casket with me.
S1004065,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I must have it certified empty before I close my report.
S1004067,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Our lads in forensic aren't interested in sanctity. Give me that casket!
S1004069,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I wouldn't arrest you if you were the last man on earth. (To Hal) Give me that casket! (He takes the casket from Hal. To Mcleavy) I'll give you a receipt, sir."
S1004071,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Did she ask to be buried like that?
S1004073,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,She was a believer in that sort of thing?
S1004075,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Are you, sir?"
S1004077,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"A member? She belonged to a group, then?"
S1004079,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I've heard many excuses for nudists, sir, but never that one."
S1004080,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Your wife was a nudist, you say?"
S1004082,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Yet she asked to be buried in that condition?
S1004084,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,In the nude.
S1004087,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"How dare you involve me in a situation for which no memo has been issued. (He turns the notes over) In all my experience I've never come across a case like it. Every one of these fivers bears a portrait of the Queen. It's dreadful to contemplate the issues raised. Twenty thousand tiaras and twenty thousand smiles buried alive! She's a constitutional monarch, you know. She can't answer back."
S1004089,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I'm sure she will.
S1004092,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Yes.
S1004094,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,She did once express a wish to see the windmills and tulip fields of Holland.
S1004096,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I never said my wife was intelligent.
S1004098,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,My wife is a woman. Intelligence doesn't really enter into the matter.
S1004100,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Where is this Jesuitical twittering leading us?
S1004102,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,How much?
S1004104,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Twenty-five per cent. Or a full report of this case appears on my superior officer's desk in the morning.
S1004106,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Thank you, lad. Most kind of you."
S1004108,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What percentage do you want?
S1004110,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,You'll have to mend your ways then.
S1004112,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Now then, sir, be reasonable. What has just taken place is perfectly scandalous and had better go no farther than these three walls. It's not expedient for the general public to have its confidence in the police force undermined. You'd be doing the community a grave disservice by revealing the full frighening facts of this case."
S1004114,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Who does?
S1004116,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Does he make sense to himself? That is much more important.
S1004119,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Good. You've carried out the operation with speed and efficiency. I congratulate you.
S1004122,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Your sense of detachment is terrifying, lad. Most people would at least flinch upon seeing their mother's eyes and teeth handed around like nuts at Christmas."
S1004124,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"We can't have him in on it, miss. Our percentage wouldn't be worth having."
S1004126,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I've been exposed before.
S1004128,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I arrested the man. He's doing twelve years.
S1004130,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"What a bright idea. We've vacancies in the force for lads of your calibre. (To Fay) Are you with us, McMahon?"
S1004133,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Good afternoon, Meadows. Why have you left your post?"
S1004135,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,What did you say?
S1004137,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Quite rightly. You're a Methodist. Proceed with the statement.
S1004139,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Excellent, Meadows. I shall see H.Q. hear of this. You have apprehended, in full flight, a most dangerous criminal. As you know, we've had our eye upon this house for some time. I was about to unmask the chief offender when this man left the room on some excuse and disappeared."
S1004141,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You have the matter in a nutshell, Meadows. Put the cuffs on him."
S1004143,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,That needn't concern you for the moment. We'll fill in the details later.
S1004145,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"I don't know where you pick up these slogans, sir. You must read them on hoardings."
S1004147,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,I am in authority. You can see me.
S1004149,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You can see whoever you like, providing you convince me first that you're justified in seeing them."
S1004151,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Nonsense. I had a check-up only yesterday. Our medical officer assured me that I was quite sane.
S1004153,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"You know the drill, Meadows. Empty his pockets and book him."
S1004156,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Oh, anything will do."
S1004158,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,Anything can be arranged in prison.
S1004160,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,,"Well, of course, the chaperon system defeats us there."
S1004161,P002,C0017,TRUSCOTT,To Fay,"The safest place for this is in my locker at the station. It's a maxim of the force: ‘Never search your own backyard you may find what you're looking for.’ (He turns in the doorway, the casket under his arm) Give me a ring this evening. I should have news for you of Mcleavy by then. (He hands a card to Fay) This is my home address. I'm well known there."
S1004134,P004,C0020,MEADOWS,,"I was accosted by this man, sir. He insisted that I accompany him to the Catholic church."
S1004136,P004,C0020,MEADOWS,,I refused.
S1004138,P004,C0020,MEADOWS,,"The man became offensive, sir. He made a number of derogatory remarks about the force in general and yourself in particular. I called for assistance."
S1004140,P004,C0020,MEADOWS,,"He was making a bolt for it, sir."
S1004167,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Here you are!
S1004169,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They’ve moved you then? When did they do that?
S1004171,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Why did they do that?
S1004173,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,The sun’s shining.
S1004175,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Of course it’s not raining. On the verandah’s where you ought to be – in the fresh air.
S1004178,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I’ll just slip them under your pillow. (Doing so.) Something sweet, that’s what you need to keep your pecker up."
S1004180,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You know what they said?
S1004182,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’re not to talk like that! Lovely flowers they have in this ward.
S1004184,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You’re in a cheerful mood, I must say."
S1004186,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That isn’t the spirit! What did you have for dinner?
S1004188,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They know what’s best. Have you got your teeth in?
S1004190,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Here. Have a sweet. Just a little one.
S1004192,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"There, she’s gone. She won’t be back. Gone to have her tea, I expect."
S1004223,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Of course it’s noisy. You want to wear ear-plugs.
S1004225,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes, ear-plugs; I’ve had to wear them for years. Have a grape? Grapie? A little one?"
S1004227,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,So you had to have an injection?
S1004229,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"And you felt better after it, didn’t you?"
S1004231,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’re getting better!
S1004233,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Oxygen?
S1004235,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"That would be nasty, I expect."
S1004237,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Still, you’re feeling better?"
S1004239,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,We’ll have you up and about in no time! (Giving him sweet.) This is a black one. You like them.
S1004241,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s the dark. It always gets worse at night.
S1004243,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Fancy!
S1004245,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Green?
S1004247,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ve got years ahead of you.
S1004249,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You mustn’t say that.
S1004251,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,We’ll have you skipping about in no time!
S1004253,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I won’t have that kind of talk, do you hear? You’ve got years ahead of you. What do you want to die for?"
S1004255,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Well?
S1004257,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ll outlive us all! People live to a hundred every day. You’ll feel better once the fine weather comes.
S1004259,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Oh yes, you will. You were always fond of spring flowers. I’ll bring you a bunch in – when they get a bit cheaper. What do you say?"
S1004261,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Oh yes, you will!"
S1004263,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ve got to stop dwelling on that subject. Have a grape?
S1004265,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Outside on the verandah’s where you ought to be. Outside in the fresh air.
S1004267,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I expect that Sister’s been getting on your nerves. No sense in getting on the patients’ nerves – I shall have a talk with her.
S1004269,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It is a bit. There! You’ve attracted nurse’s attention. She’s coming over.
S1004271,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I think he’s a bit depressed today, nurse."
S1004273,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No.
S1004275,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He’s thinking of Mum – we lost her about this time of the year.
S1004277,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I think so. Comfortable, are you? Nurse says are you comfortable? (He nods.) With the nice weather coming on, I was surprised he wasn’t out on the verandah. That’d be nice for him."
S1004279,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Is it?
S1004281,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I expect you know best. I mean, it stands to reason."
S1004283,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Does it?
S1004285,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That’s a funny direction for a verandah to face.
S1004287,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It must hardly get any sun?
S1004289,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I wouldn’t think that it did.
S1004291,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"It’s not old, then?"
S1004293,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I thought I didn’t remember it.
S1004295,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I suppose not. (To KEMP
S1004298,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He worries me sometimes.
S1004300,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,And you’d let me know if there was?
S1004302,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Just remember that!
S1004304,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Well, we’ll just have to keep our fingers crossed. I’ll see you again before I go, shall I?"
S1004305,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Good.
S1004307,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You heard what she said? As long as you’re cheerful, you’ll be out in a month."
S1004382,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Janice sends her love. And was there anything special you wanted?
S1004384,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"She’s doing well, Janice is."
S1004386,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Mrs Flackwell wishes to be remembered.
S1004388,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Mrs Flackwell. Her with the bad leg.
S1004390,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"She says they’re all asking after you down at the club. You’re remembered, you see. She asked about visiting time."
S1004392,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"So she’ll be coming along, I expect. They all think a lot of you. Don’t pretend different. She hasn’t forgot all you did for her when their Stanley died. No. She hasn’t."
S1004394,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I don’t think she’s been the same since. It was a shock to her system. Some people would be in a mental home with what Mrs Flackwell’s had to put up with. It would of given some people a break-down. Not her, she’s one of the best. (Pause.) I’ll tell her you’re better. (Pause.) You wouldn’t want not to be remembered to her, would you?"
S1004396,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,She has.
S1004398,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You are in a mood today, aren’t you?"
S1004400,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ll see Mrs Flackwell again.
S1004402,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ll see all of us underground.
S1004404,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes, you will. Don’t upset yourself. Here comes nurse with your tea. Sit up then! Sit up. There you are. Mind your hands! It’s on wheels – have you noticed? I expect you have. It’s on wheels to make it easier – you wheel it backwards or forwards, as you like. (Pause.) I could do with a cup myself."
S1004406,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No.
S1004408,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Tea is for patients. I’m only a visitor. What would she think?
S1004410,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Having a bit of a moan. That’s his way. It’s the time of the year.
S1004413,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Make up your mind; nurse is waiting.
S1004415,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You see how he is? (To KEMP
S1004417,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Come on, have a nice piece of bread and butter? A nice piece of cake then? A piece of Brown bread? Don’t you fancy it?"
S1004419,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Just a cup of tea, nurse."
S1004421,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"He’s always ready for that. I’ve never known him say no to a cup of tea. That’s right – hold it steady. Don’t spill any, or nurse will tell you off. Won’t you, nurse? She’ll tell you off. (Silence.) Can you hear music?"
S1004423,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I don’t mind.
S1004425,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Not if you’re supposed to keep it open. He plays well, that accordionist."
S1004429,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Have a nice cake?
S1004431,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Have this bun – look, it has icing on. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?"
S1004433,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s not what I want at all. It’s what you want. (To nurse.) Is he like this all the time? (To KEMP
S1004436,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s not very tasty. (Pause.) I couldn’t find him at first.
S1004438,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They’d moved him. I thought at first that they’d moved him back into Mary Ward.
S1004440,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"He was. But I don’t think it suited him. I should say, nurse, it’s given him a new lease of life being in this ward. There isn’t a doubt of it. He’s looking more of his old self. He has a definite flush in his cheeks."
S1004442,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I’ve marked them.
S1004444,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I hope I’ve done the right thing, but I wouldn’t want someone else getting his eggs. You wouldn’t do it on purpose, I know, but accidents happen. I wouldn’t begrudge another patient an egg; it’s just that I brought them for him, and I’d like to think of him getting them."
S1004446,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I’m not sure whether this one is light enough. It has to be something light or he won’t be bothered. Some of these books nowadays make me frightened. (Pause.) You wouldn’t think that a book could have that effect, would you? But it does. I usually ask a friend of mine if she’s read it, and if she has then it’s all right. You’d wonder why they print some of those books. I picked one up last week, Life in the Space Age. I ask you! Who wants to read about life in the Space Age? Still, I suppose it’s all for the best. We’ve got to move with the times, haven’t we? Move or be left behind."
S1004449,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Did you enjoy it?
S1004451,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Well, that’s something to be thankful for."
S1004453,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,The nurse wants your cup!
S1004457,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Have you finished?
S1004459,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Then give nurse your plate. Do you want something else?
S1004462,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Sure?
S1004464,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"That’ll be all then. He enjoyed his tea. You didn’t want to have any, did you? If we hadn’t nearly forced you, you’d never have had any. Isn’t that so? And I’m sure you’re feeling the better for it. Hurry up with that cup now; nurse wants to clear away. (Pause.) I shall be having my tea when I get in."
S1004467,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He wants you!
S1004471,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Of course you’ll live to July. You’ll live for years!
S1004473,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I’m glad you’re here, nurse, to reassure him. He won’t take a scrap of notice of me."
S1004477,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He will keep saying things like that.
S1004479,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Of course you will. Won’t he, nurse?"
S1004483,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Toffee?
S1004484,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He likes something sweet.
S1004486,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It won’t happen again.
S1004488,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I will.
S1004490,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,One toffee can’t do much harm.
S1004492,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I know. It’s no fun being a nurse, is it?"
S1004494,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"No fun. These young girls think it’s fun. They read these books about nurses getting off with the doctors, and they think it’s true. They think nurses have nothing better to do than to fill their heads with thoughts about men. Man-mad they are! You nurses have got other things to think about."
S1004742,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,How do you do? I’m not stopping long. How are you?
S1004744,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Not cold out here, are you?"
S1004746,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"No, you’re looking better. In yourself, I mean. Did they give you your egg?"
S1004748,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Only one? (He nods.) You’d think they’d give you more than one, wouldn’t you? It’s not as though they had to pay for them. (Pause.) I spoke to that man who plays the accordion."
S1004750,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Yes. He plays so well that I felt I ought to. I felt it incumbent upon me. I told him what I thought of his playing. But I told him I didn’t think he ought to play outside hospitals. I told him he ought to think of the patients. I’m surprised no one’s complained before now. (Pause.) He’s a war veteran.
S1004752,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Think he might have been a friend of yours?
S1004754,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He didn’t say his name. Couldn’t be expected to.
S1004756,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Didn’t you?
S1004758,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Him and me had quite a chat. He was telling me – out in all weathers. He stopped playing while he talked – well, it stands to reason. I think, if it’s wet, he nips into the pub on the corner."
S1004760,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Neither do I. He lost three of his fingers in Flanders. So he said. Well, I suppose he might have been spinning me a tale. But he never misses them, he says. In fact he thinks it improved his playing. He plays very loud. (Pause.) I told him about you being wounded. On the Somme, wasn’t it?"
S1004762,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That’s where I thought it was.
S1004764,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Where was it then?
S1004766,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No? Where was it? I’d like to have a word with him on my way out – correct the impression.
S1004768,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Oh. Then where was it?
S1004773,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Is it? You wouldn’t know me.
S1004775,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You don’t know me, do you? But I’ve just realised, I know you. It came to me suddenly. Isn’t your wife a tall lady with glasses, name of Irene, belongs to the Mere End social club?"
S1004778,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,She must have spoken to you about me. I’ve been to your house.
S1004780,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes. She’s an active woman, isn’t she? Keeps on her feet."
S1004783,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You work for the Council, don’t you?"
S1004785,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,How long is it? Forty-three years?
S1004787,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Irene’s often told me. She’s proud of your record. It isn’t often you meet people nowadays who take a pride in their work. That’s what makes them so discontented. And you take a pride in your work, don’t you? I can see you do."
S1004789,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"On the dust-bins, weren’t you?"
S1004791,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Oh, is that different?"
S1004793,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I believe your wife mentioned it to me.
S1004795,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It must have slipped my mind.
S1004797,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It must be nice for you inside – out of the wet? Nice and dry?
S1004799,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes, we can’t do with too much outside weather as we get older. The damp does nobody any good. What do you pick?"
S1004801,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Must be worth a fortune!
S1004803,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,A gold-mine!
S1004805,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Fancy.
S1004807,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Paper as well?
S1004809,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Do they pay you when you’re off work?
S1004811,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I’m glad to hear that. Yes, I’m glad you’ve had no trouble with them. (Pause.) The dust must be bad for your chest."
S1004813,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"What are the men like? They look a bit rough, some of them. I hope you don’t mind my saying that?"
S1004815,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Are they quarrelsome?
S1004817,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I thought so. They look that way.
S1004819,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s an essential service. No doubt about that. Do you get a bath where you work?
S1004821,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Do you get a bath?
S1004823,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I was just interested.
S1004825,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I just enquired. (Pause.) I expect you’d need one.
S1004827,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It stands to reason.
S1004829,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It must be difficult.
S1004832,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I’ve noticed nothing.
S1004899,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I thought he might. What’s he in for?
S1004901,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Did he.
S1004903,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I don’t understand it. It makes no sense. He looks harmless enough. Still you never can tell from a man’s face what he may be thinking. He may look harmless, but is he?"
S1004905,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He often isn’t. It just goes to show you can’t judge by appearances. (Rummages in bag.) I know what I’ve got here for you. I clean forgot. (Hands him snapshot.)
S1004907,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Janice.
S1004909,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Takes after Madge. Madge was always on the big side.
S1004911,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,The horse.
S1004913,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Didn’t I tell you? Janice goes horseback riding now, in the country on Saturday afternoons. That’s the horse she rides. Regular as clockwork."
S1004915,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That’s what I’d like to know. Though Fred’s earning good money now. That’s why she doesn’t mind spending a bob or two on those lessons. The lady at the riding school has taken quite a fancy to Janice – so Madge tells me.
S1004917,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,She’s a smart woman. Very smart. It’ll do Janice good. That kind of woman can bring a girl out.
S1004919,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I don’t think there’s any risk of that.
S1004921,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"That’s her. The woman I was telling you of. A refined expression, hasn’t she? I mean, you’d trust your daughter with her. (Pause.) You can’t run a stables and not be otherwise."
S1004923,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,A corgi.
S1004925,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Madge says that Janice is on about having one. She’s seen this woman’s dog and wants one for herself.
S1004927,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"They’re all the same. What one has, the other wants. (Pause.) It must cost her a bit. There’s the hire of the horse. Janice hasn’t one of her own, you know. There’s no room for a horse where they live."
S1004929,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Very keen.
S1004931,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,She’s busy.
S1004933,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You don’t realise how full her hands are what with Fred out all day and Janice growing so fast. (Pause.) Did I tell you Mrs Flackwell had brought off the treble chance?
S1004935,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Everyone had it last week. Twenty-eight and ninepence. Still that’s not a bad return for sixpence. It isn’t, is it?"
S1004937,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Have you finished with it? (Takes back photograph.) I shall have to be off. I only dropped in for a few minutes.
S1004939,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I expect so. I’m not over-fond of this place. Is there anything special I can bring in when I do come?
S1004941,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I expect you’d like that.
S1004943,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ve got expensive tastes! I’ll look around for Jaffas then. (Pause.) I expect by Easter you’ll be on your feet. You can sit in the park. They’ve painted that shelter.
S1004945,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes, painted it green. It’ll be waiting for you."
S1004947,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You want to hurry up and get better.
S1004949,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I can see that. (Picking up her hold-all.) I shall be off then. Cheerio. (Giving perfunctory kiss.)
S1004951,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Don’t you worry. I can take care of myself. Bye, bye."
S1004988,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Oh, here you are. (Pause.) I didn’t know whether they’d let you come round to see me."
S1004990,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,A bit better.
S1004992,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,There’s no need.
S1004994,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,She never came in before.
S1004997,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Nothing much. They’re having trouble again with their Molly.
S1004999,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Yes. I don’t know why she tells me these things, I’m sure. It’s very embarrassing – I wish she wouldn’t."
S1005001,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,The usual. (Sighing.) Molly was always the wild one. It’s all on account of her being born between two boys – she got spoiled. How many times have I said to Mrs Flackwell
S1005003,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I know, it upsets me. I think the world of Molly. Still, it isn’t the kind of thing you like to hear about. And that Mrs Flackwell spares me no details – not one."
S1005006,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Control?
S1005008,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Oh, I agree with you. Goes to school if she feels like it, and doesn’t if she doesn’t. I shall tell Evie that as well. I shall have to run the risk of offending her. (Cheering up.) Though, likely as not, those policemen are making a mountain out of a mole-hill. All the same you do hear of some terrible things happening. It makes you wonder. You hear so many awful things."
S1005010,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Of course she should.
S1005012,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"You’re never going to tell me a girl of her age … Well, it’s too late now."
S1005014,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"The damage is done. As things stand, I doubt if it can ever be repaired. I may be getting old, but things like this worry me. They do."
S1005016,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No doubt.
S1005018,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Not Molly. She’ll be revelling in it. It might be the very best thing if she got sent away to a home.
S1005020,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It would. I think their Molly in a home would just break her heart.
S1005022,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,And she hasn’t properly got over Stanley yet. Some people seem fated. I wish there was something I could do.
S1005024,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No.
S1005026,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I wish I could. But you know me – always worrying. Something glandular, I expect. Of course I don’t know – I’m no authority. All the same I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that it was."
S1005028,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What other one?
S1005030,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Oh?
S1005032,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They’re all the same.
S1005034,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s the same kind of chair.
S1005036,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I think it is.
S1005038,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,It’s not worth it.
S1005040,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ll have to be quick. There she is.
S1005042,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Wait until next time. Don’t do it now.
S1005044,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Want one?
S1005046,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I’m not fond of them. Much too watery. You feel cheated after a grape. I like a nice apple. What are you doing?
S1005048,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Is it not comfortable?
S1005050,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That nice old man in the end bed?
S1005052,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What a shame. It does seem a pity. He hadn’t retired long?
S1005054,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"It makes you wonder why such things happen. It does seem awful. He was a young man – young for nowadays, I should say."
S1005056,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They’ll have to postpone the wedding now.
S1005058,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"They’re not going to? (He shakes his head.) Not going to postpone the – ? oh, but I do think that’s wrong. It won’t look right. They should show a bit of respect. No sooner get him into the grave than they’re dancing about. It’s downright disrespectful. If I was his granddaughter, it’d upset me. He ought to mean something to her. But that’s the trouble nowadays – no respect! I know life has got to go on, but it ought not to go on so quickly."
S1005060,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I expect that’s it. I expect it’s her fault. No sooner are they out of school, than they want to get married. I don’t suppose she can even cook. (Pause.) They’re supposed to leave school trained in cooking – supposed, I say! Why, they can’t even boil an egg. Some of these young girls’ ideas of cooking are rudimentary. Rudimentary! They couldn’t boil a kettle. It’s not right. And yet they go and get married."
S1005062,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I should say it’s the parents who are to blame. Definitely. They want to put their feet down. Mind you, some of these young girls aren’t bad. Give credit where credit’s due. Some of them have got their heads screwed on. Our Janice says she’s not going to get married until she’s twenty-one. Well, that’s sensible. She’ll have had time to mature. These young girls that rush into marriage, don’t understand what’s involved. They’re not as innocent as I was, but they don’t know as much as they think they do."
S1005064,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,No. I do think you should approach marriage knowing something.
S1005070,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’re not supposed to sit on the bed.
S1005072,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’re not supposed to.
S1005074,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Well, you know her. She looks as though she had starch for breakfast. She’s not married, is she?"
S1005076,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I wouldn’t think so. I know her type. Likes to take it out on you. Sometimes you’d wonder if they were human. I spoke to her, when I came to visit you in the other ward. Did I tell you? After they’d moved you, and I didn’t know where you were. I spoke to her. ‘Oh, ask one of the nurses,’ she said. Why couldn’t she tell me? I bet she couldn’t be bothered. Couldn’t be bothered to collect her thoughts and give me a civil answer. She looks a misery. There she is, rushing up and down in her starched hat – and all the time she’s in a greater state of ignorance than my cat!"
S1005078,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"That’s it. Ask them a question, and they don’t know. Too busy thinking of other things. (Pause.) It’s the staff shortage, I expect. They have to take what they can get. Anything the Labour Exchange likes to send along. That’s it, isn’t it? She’s taking advantage of full employment. In the old days, she’d have been out of a job. I know her kind – selfishness. That’s all they think about. Self, self, self. She was in a hurry just now to get off and have a chat in her office over a cup of tea. Everyone’s in a hurry nowadays. Rush, rush, rush. Where’s it all going to stop?"
S1005080,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Well, isn’t that like him? They’ll be ringing the bell soon, won’t they?"
S1005082,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,When?
S1005084,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Oh. Only that sister.
S1005086,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,The one in the glasses.
S1005088,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Is that her name?
S1005090,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Thank you.
S1005092,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Who?
S1005094,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I don’t know. It’s a man, I shouldn’t wonder. Women like that never give up. They never admit defeat. She’ll be after some man when she’s a hundred. She must be a good age now. You can tell by her mouth. Still she may have had an unhappy life. She may have adopted her attitude out of disappointment. You can’t go around with a long face for ever though. You make the best of it. I thought at one time that I should never smile again."
S1005096,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Of course you do. Is he still asleep?
S1005098,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I don’t know if he is. He can be very deaf if he wants to. (Pause.) Nearly all the doctors here seem to be women?
S1005100,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You do?
S1005102,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Is she?
S1005104,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Have you been a nurse long?
S1005106,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You’ll be thinking of getting married?
S1005108,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Perhaps not though – it’s a kind of vocation, isn’t it? Like a Nun. (Pause.) He tells me that Mr Wilkins died. Was it expected?"
S1005110,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I expect you always expect it. They may look as right as rain to us, but you know. It doesn’t come as any surprise to you, does it? You know. You know from the X-rays, the blood-tests, the temperature charts. (Pause.) If only he’d waited until after the wedding. It had nothing to do with him, though, did it? He had no choice."
S1005112,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"His granddaughter’s. You know, the pretty one."
S1005114,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Then I don’t suppose you would. (Pause.) That girl can’t think much of him. Not much. You’d think she’d allow a decent period of mourning. That’s the least you could expect. But no. She’ll want to be off. I’ve been married for thirty years. That’s a long time. They think that it’s just one long honeymoon, but it’s not. There’s not much that you can tell me about marriage."
S1005115,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,You must be tired?
S1005117,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I expect that you’ll put your feet up?
S1005119,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I feel like that sometimes. I feel as though I could sleep for a fortnight. It must be a long day for you.
S1005121,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"That was what got me down on the buses. Up and down, up and down, all day long. My feet used to burn by the time I knocked off. Burning they were! I’d sit for hours with them in a bowl of water. Yes, I’d have my tea and listen to the news with my feet in a bowl. (Pause.) I was just wondering … not that it’s anything to do with me … but that was an interesting thing you were saying about that Dr Barnes. I’d never trust myself in the hands of some of these doctors."
S1005123,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What?
S1005125,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I thought you were. (Confidentially.) Do you know, I don’t believe some of them are doctors at all. They’re students. Nothing but students. You never know whether they’re not just using you for an experiment. Whether you’re not their first case. It’s all an experiment really, isn’t it? Sometimes it frightens me."
S1005126,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What?
S1005128,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"No. Do you know, I lie awake at night sometimes and think what would happen if they put a student onto me. Oh, you can laugh, nurse, but it’s a real fear!"
S1005130,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I should be very surprised if you did. You don’t look the kind of girl that’d laugh when somebody told you their secret fears. All the same, I don’t believe some of these hospitals care. What is it to them? It might be your father or your mother lying in that bed, but to them it’s just hard work. (Pause.) I don’t believe some of these students are hardly trained at all. It’s a shocking waste of affairs, but what can you do? It’s a shocking waste of time. You might as well save your breath. I’ve no doubt, nurse, just by looking at one of these students, you can tell whether he’s in control. You can tell at a glance. But I can’t. No. It isn’t possible. I haven’t got the qualifications."
S1005132,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What did you say?
S1005134,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Well, you are in a depressing mood. I suppose she’ll be in in a minute with that bell of hers. What with that and the crows’ feet round her eyes, it makes her an object of terror. She handles it like a club! The way she stands there waving it, you’d wonder if she was qualified to care for the sick."
S1005138,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I’ve woken you.
S1005303,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I could see you were miles away. While I was speaking, I said to myself"
S1005305,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,That’s a good sign. (Speaking loudly.) I said that we have to go sometime.
S1005308,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I’ve never believed that death was the end. I believe we shall see the people we love again. I was taught that we shall. I can’t stand these people who try to depress you by saying there’s nothing else. I always turn a deaf ear to those kind of people. How can they know? There’s a woman in our street who’s such an atheist. ‘I’M an ATHEIST,’ she’ll say, as bold as brass. Miserable she is. Miserable as sin. Well, you can’t put up with them, can you? You’ll never get me to believe we shan’t meet the people we love again. It wouldn’t be natural."
S1005310,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I wonder if it’ll be just like going to sleep.
S1005312,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Going to sleep is nice.
S1005314,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Of course it is. I remember when Eddie went … Funny. I can’t remember what he looked like now. We had a snap of him taken in the back garden when he was a kid. That’s how I remember him. I never thought I’d forget Eddie’s face. But I did. He’d have been almost forty if he’d been alive. He’d have been married, with kids of his own. How time flies. It’s doesn’t seem long, though. It doesn’t seem long."
S1005316,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,Yes.
S1005318,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"No, thank you."
S1005320,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I don’t know how he can. Not in the chair like that! (Pause.) He’s getting better, you know, but he won’t admit it."
S1005322,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He doesn’t like to admit it. Thinks he may not get quite so much sympathy when he’s better.
S1005324,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I bet he’s not really asleep. He pretends he can’t hear us, but he can. Look at him lying there – there’s a smile on his face."
S1005326,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,What is it?
S1005336,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He’s … dead.
S1006332,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I brought you these. (Produces a tin of toffee.) I know you’re not supposed to have them, but I thought you’d like to.                                                                                                                                                          "
S1006333,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,We thought we were going to lose him in Mary Ward. (Loudly.) Didn’t we think we were going to lose you in Mary Ward?
S1006334,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"I brought these eggs for him. Shall I give them to Sister, or will you take charge of them?"
S1006335,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,He never seemed to get on well with the nurses in Mary Ward. I expect he got on their nerves.
S1006336,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,They moved you then.
S1006337,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,BASSET,"Is your name by any chance Reg, Mr BASSET?"
S1006338,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,, I’m sure you are.
S1006339,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I’ve had a letter this morning from Mrs Flackwell.
S1006340,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,"Apparently the policewoman said she’d never come across a case like it. I expect she was exaggerating though. They’re great ones for exaggerating, these policewomen. I shall tell Mrs Flackwell so – when I see her. That’s what I’ll tell her. I daresay she stands in need of a bit of comfort."
S1006341,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,KEMP,"Oh, very well.

S1006342,P004,C0023,MRS PLATT,,I don’t know. We hope that it’s heaven.
S1004193,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Did anyone hear the racing results?
S1004195,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Did you, Sims?"
S1004197,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Back a horse? (Sims nods.) What was it?
S1004199,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Not a chance.
S1004201,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,It was – ten years ago!
S1004203,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Who did you get it from?
S1004205,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Her tips will ruin you. She’ll have you in the workhouse. (To Sims.) They go around in Dublin, giving each other these tips. Dead certs! They’re gambling mad."
S1004207,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Bookies win oftener.
S1004210,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Why?
S1004212,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,What a hole. (To O’Hara.) How much have you lost on the horses since Christmas?
S1004214,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,How much?
S1004216,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"All right, keep your hair on, O’Hara."
S1004218,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"As soon as you earn it, you throw it away. You’re as bad, Sims. It gets me down. I’m soft hearted. I can’t bear to see you throwing your hard-earned wages away."
S1004220,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"That’s none of your business! You’d better get into the ward, O’Hara. There’s no one about."
S1004670,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Have you got enough clothes on?
S1004672,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Have you changed your pyjamas, Mr BASSET?"
S1004674,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Why not? Why haven’t you changed your pyjamas?
S1004676,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Didn’t you have a bath last night?
S1004678,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Why not?
S1004680,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Were you excused?
S1004682,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Did you change them last week?
S1004684,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,What do you mean? Did you have a bath last week?
S1004686,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"I see. You must have a very short memory. Now, Mr BASSET, this is no way to carry on."
S1004688,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"I’d like to know what you’re playing at, Mr BASSET. It’s not a joke. You’ve not had a bath for a fortnight. You haven’t changed your pyjamas. Did you have a bath when you were admitted?"
S1004690,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,You had two baths on the same day?
S1004692,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,And you think that keeps you clean for a fortnight?
S1004694,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"I should like to know just what you do think, Mr BASSET. (Nods.) Very well. (Turns to KEMP"
S1004696,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Are you sure? It doesn’t look comfortable. (Goes to door and calls:) Sims! Sims! Come here. (Coming back to the bed.) Did you see the doctor this morning?
S1004699,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Hadn’t you better?
S1004701,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"This patient’s bed isn’t comfortable, nurse."
S1004703,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Make it.
S1004704,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Your daughter is coming to see you this morning. Have you got your pipe?
S1004706,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Be careful you don’t set yourself on fire. This patient hasn’t had a movement this morning, nurse."
S1004708,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"In future I want you to tell nurse, Mr KEMP"
S1004710,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Very good.
S1004849,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"What’s the matter, nurse?"
S1004852,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,You must have a bath.
S1004854,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,You’ve no choice. It’s regulations. Where are your clean pyjamas? Are they in your locker?
S1004856,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,And are they aired? Have you asked nurse to air them for you?
S1004858,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,What prevented you?
S1004860,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Are they in your locker?
S1004862,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Top or bottom?
S1004864,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Are they thick?
S1004866,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,They may be thin?
S1004868,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,They may be unsuitable? Does your wife know this? (He nods.) When is she visiting you?
S1004870,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Is she on the telephone? Can she be reached?
S1004872,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,She can’t?
S1004876,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,After breakfast?
S1004878,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,In here?
S1004880,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"I see. Come along now, Mr BASSET, that bath is getting cold. What have you got against it?"
S1004882,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"You seem to be. Are you sure that you’re feeling well? Have you taken Mr BASSET' temperature this morning, nurse?"
S1004884,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Take it now. (Pause.) Now, Mr BASSET, why do you refuse to take a bath?"
S1004886,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,That’s quite beside the point.
S1004888,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Does he?
S1004890,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,But you need a bath. (As though the matter is quite disposed of.) Leave your dirty pyjamas in the bathroom. Did you take your sedative this morning?
S1004892,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Why not?
S1004897,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"This is inexcusable behaviour, Mr BASSET. You know that, don’t you? I shall have to speak to the doctor about it. Now come along now – no more nonsense. Nurse, take his arm."
S1005065,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Don’t sit on the bed, if you don’t mind."
S1005067,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Sit on the chair that’s provided.
S1005069,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Listen to them! They’ve no consideration. Banging the doors shut – you’d think you were in an asylum!
S1005240,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Which of you is supposed to be on duty?
S1005241,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Who’s on the ward now?
S1005242,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,What’s the time?
S1005244,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"What are you doing, Brown?"
S1005246,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Not till four-thirty?
S1005248,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,It isn’t four-thirty.
S1005250,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,What’s your excuse?
S1005252,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"I see. You shouldn’t have left the ward unattended, O’Hara."
S1005254,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,I didn’t see her as I came through. Was Mr BASSET given his sedative?
S1005256,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Did he make any objection?
S1005258,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Good.
S1005272,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"One moment, Brown."
S1005274,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Mr KEMP  says that he missed his supper last night?
S1005276,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,You should have woken him. He shouldn’t go too long between meals.
S1005278,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,"Don’t ask me questions, Brown. So he had no supper? (Pause.) Didn’t he want any?"
S1005280,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Why wasn’t he given any?
S1005282,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,Who told you that it was too late?
S1005285,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,That has nothing to do with it.
S1005287,P004,C0024,SISTER MARQUAND,,That isn’t the point. (Pause.) Very well. I shall remember this.
S1004194,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"No, sister."
S1004200,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s a good horse.
S1004202,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I had a tip.

S1004213,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Not much.
S1004215,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I don’t keep a book.
S1004217,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,The friend that I had it from is reliable.
S1004270,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Everything all right?
S1004272,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,He mustn’t be.
S1004274,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,What is there for him to be depressed about?
S1004276,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I see. Is he comfortable?
S1004278,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,The verandah’s draughty.
S1004280,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Too draughty.
S1004282,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It faces north.
S1004284,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It does.
S1004286,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It was the only place they could build it.
S1004288,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It doesn’t.
S1004290,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Three weeks we had the builders in and out.
S1004292,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s very recent.

S1004299,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,There’s nothing to worry about.

S1004315,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,He hasn’t heard it from anyone. He just knows.

S1004329,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Here it says grey.
S1004331,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Here it is.
S1004338,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,What’s the matter?
S1004340,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Go on. She’s all right.
S1004342,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,You and who else?
S1004344,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,You’ll what?
S1004347,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"Tell her, not us."
S1004349,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,You wouldn’t say that to her face.
S1004351,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,That Sister would eat you.
S1004353,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,She’d make mincemeat of you. She’ll eat you with salad.
S1004357,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Don’t make me laugh!
S1004359,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,That’ll be for me. (Answers it.) Yes? Yes. (Replaces receiver.) Tea.

S1004363,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Are you serious?
S1004409,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"All right, is he?"
S1004411,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Cake or bread and butter?
S1004416,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,No. He’s the last. Cake or bread and butter?
S1004420,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Here you are.
S1004422,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s from the street. Is it annoying you?
S1004424,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I’ll close the window.
S1004426,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Sure you won’t have something to eat?
S1004428,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s a long time to supper.
S1004430,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Will you?
S1004435,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,The plain one? That’ll be nice.
S1004437,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Why not?
S1004439,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Is that where he was?

S1004443,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,That’s right.
S1004445,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Put it there on his locker.
S1004447,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Have you finished with your cup?
S1004452,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Give me your cup.
S1004455,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,That’s a good sign!
S1004461,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,That’s right.
S1004466,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,What is it?
S1004469,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Twenty-two.
S1004472,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"Well, what do you make of that? Now, you’re not to upset yourself."
S1004475,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s not?
S1004480,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,He will.
S1004482,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"Here, let me make you comfortable. (She plumps his pillow.) That’s better. It makes all the difference. (Pause.) What’s this? Who’s been giving him toffee?"
S1004485,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,But he isn’t supposed to have it. I’m surprised at you. I thought you had more sense. I don’t know what Sister would say. She’d give you the rough edge of her tongue.
S1004487,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Promise me?
S1004489,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Some of you visitors – I think you want to kill the patients.
S1004491,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,"You might as well give him poison. If you don’t believe me, ask Sister!"
S1004493,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,It’s not bad. I must be off with these dishes or Sister will be chasing me up.
S1004515,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Where’s Cameron?
S1004517,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,What’s the time?

S1005217,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,She must be very intelligent.

S1005222,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,These books shouldn’t be allowed.
S1005224,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,No wonder that everybody’s going on the streets.
S1005226,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I can’t understand people writing that kind of book.
S1005228,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,What kind of mind must they have?
S1005230,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,I wouldn’t be entertained.
S1005233,P004,C0026,O’HARA,,Daniel Proust. I think I’ve heard of him.

S1004322,P004,C0025,SIM,,"Oh, her. Yes, she was gorgeous."
S1004324,P004,C0025,SIM,,There’ll be a repeat. You ought to have seen her – she knows how to handle horses.

S1004345,P004,C0025,SIM,,She’s a difficult woman.
S1004355,P004,C0025,SIM,,And what will she say?

S1004365,P004,C0025,SIM,,You were a fool to say that.
S1004367,P004,C0025,SIM,,In front of O’Hara.
S1004369,P004,C0025,SIM,,It’ll go back. She’ll go and tell Marquand every word you’ve been saying. See if I’m not right.
S1004371,P004,C0025,SIM,,That’s what she’ll do.
S1004377,P004,C0025,SIM,,O’Hara is a terrible bitch.

S1004531,P004,C0025,SIM,,"Well, it was O’Hara put the poison down. Told Sister Marquand Cameron was responsible."
S1004534,P004,C0025,SIM,,Who brought them?
S1004538,P004,C0025,SIM,,What is it?

S1004977,P004,C0025,SIM,,"We don’t want to have her in here as well. Oh, watch how you go!"
S1004979,P004,C0025,SIM,,There she goes – threading her way among the traffic.
S1004981,P004,C0025,SIM,,"She’s a wonderful woman, for her age. Is she your only daughter?"

S1005206,P004,C0025,SIM,,It is difficult.
S1005208,P004,C0025,SIM,,It doesn’t agree with her. It made her feel bad.

S1005265,P004,C0025,SIM,,"She is, you know."
S1005267,P004,C0025,SIM,,"Since she first saw him. She couldn’t keep still, and her colour came and went."

S1004335,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Upset?
S1004337,P004,C0027,BROWN,,There’ll be somebody upset before long. If she says one more word to me …
S1004339,P004,C0027,BROWN,,That Sister Bloody Marquand’s too fond of finding fault. That’s what’s the matter.
S1004343,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"I’m not staying here all my life, and before I leave, I shall make her jump! Just let her open her mouth once, that’s all. I’ll have that hat half way down her throat!"
S1004346,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Difficult! Just let me get a win on the pools, that’s all I ask, and I’ll have her running through that ward as if a regiment of Gurkhas was after her!"
S1004348,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I will.
S1004350,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Wouldn’t I?
S1004352,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She’d what?
S1004354,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"What! I’ll give Matron notice in writing. ‘Matron,’ I’ll say, ‘I hereby give notice that on such-and-such a day I intend to do Sister Marquand.’"
S1004356,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She’ll say
S1004358,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I wasn’t in the Girl Guides for nothing.

S1004364,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What do you think?
S1004366,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What?
S1004368,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What can I do – I’m so impetuous.
S1004370,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I’m crying!
S1004372,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She’s welcome.
S1004374,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Let her tell Marquand, I’m independent. I’m not crawling – my old job’s waiting for me. I can always go back to making Brown paper bags!"
S1004376,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Still with us, I see. Aren’t you, dear? She’s a nice girl, though."
S1004378,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You’re telling me nothing I didn’t know.
S1004380,P004,C0027,BROWN,,It’s the upbringing. Nuns are a dozy lot. No wonder they turn out cretins like that O’Hara.
S1004495,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I prefer her sister.
S1004497,P004,C0027,BROWN,,How are you getting on?
S1004498,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Yes. I’m against it myself.
S1004500,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What’s that you’re knitting?
S1004502,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Never! It’s the wrong shape.
S1004504,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Who are you knitting it for – an octopus?
S1004506,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You can’t always trust them. You’ve got the wrong needles in for a kick-off.
S1004508,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I’m trying to help.
S1004510,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What’s the wool?

S1004514,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She’s as bad as you are. Oh, well, you know what you’re doing. It’s your look-out. You’ll have a cardigan like a herring net. Still, you can always use it as a mop."
S1004516,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She’ll be in.
S1004519,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You surprise me.
S1004521,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Trust me, Mary."
S1004523,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Don’t bother about her. She’s glued to the pages.
S1004524,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She’s had her nose in between those two covers so long it’s beginning to look like a book-mark. What is it? (Twisting her head round to see the title.) Swann’s Way. I didn’t know you were interested in birds?
S1004526,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What’s it about then?
S1004528,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She thinks I’m dead ignorant. Take a look at her eyes. Aren’t they blood-shot? It’s all this reading. You’ll kill yourself, dear. Honest. And she looked so fresh at first. We all noticed it when she came. But what were you saying?"
S1004530,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Do I? Marquand nearly wet herself, didn’t she? Eh? Tried to blame it on me. She rushed in here effing and blinding. ‘I’ll have you up before Matron,’ she said. Oh, she’s wicked when she starts."
S1004532,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You can’t trust Paddies. They’re a two-faced lot.
S1004536,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Every time she comes she brings eggs; I think she must lay them herself.
S1004537,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Hey, up!"
S1004541,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Is it Marquand?
S1004543,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I bet it is.
S1004546,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Is that all?
S1004734,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Which of you is it for a bath? (Silence.) Come along. Which of you is it?
S1004736,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"No, I didn’t wait to ask. Is it you, Mr BASSET? Now then, what’s your game? Sister came in here –"
S1004738,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Did she tell you for a bath, Mr BASSET, or didn’t she? (Pause.) Did you have one last night?"
S1004740,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Then she means you.
S1004834,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Your bath’s ready now. Where are your clean pyjamas? (Pause.) Did you say you had clean pyjamas? Do you want them aired?
S1004836,P004,C0027,BROWN,,They are clean?
S1004838,P004,C0027,BROWN,,And they’ve been aired?
S1004840,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You haven’t worn them before?
S1004842,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Come along then.
S1004844,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I wouldn’t know.
S1004846,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Look here – what have you got against taking a bath.
S1004848,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Come along now – get busy with that soap.
S1004850,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Patient refuses to have a bath.
S1004883,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"No, sister."

S1004895,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Where did you throw it?
S1005141,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Go on.
S1005143,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Look at her eyes, quite violet those bags."
S1005148,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Say what you like, she’s a trouper!"
S1005152,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She’d talk the hind leg off a donkey, that woman."
S1005157,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What’s the matter?
S1005159,P004,C0027,BROWN,,When did this happen?
S1005162,P004,C0027,BROWN,,But then there are so many lines to read between.
S1005163,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"No, dear."
S1005166,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She’s right. She’s told me many a time how much self-control she has. Haven’t you, dear?"
S1005168,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Time and again.
S1005169,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What for?
S1005171,P004,C0027,BROWN,,D’you think it’ll mind?
S1005175,P004,C0027,BROWN,,No problem then.
S1005177,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Hark at her!
S1005179,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What were you doing to lose control in the first place?
S1005181,P004,C0027,BROWN,,It’s a nice time now to start wondering.
S1005183,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You mustn’t make a habit of it.
S1005188,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You must be off your flipping head.
S1005190,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Going round with that type.
S1005192,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Are they his own?
S1005194,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"It was the uniform that got you – no need to tell me! You had to have something fancy – and it’s all because she’s frigid. No, but you are. You told me."
S1005196,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Wouldn’t she? You don’t know Eileen. How old is he?
S1005198,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"You want your head examining, love! They’ll have you for kidnapping. (Pause.) Well, never mind. Least said, soonest mended. Sims here can knit you a layette."
S1005202,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"But you’d better watch out. Look at that! A cardigan she’s calling it. She’ll make your baby clothes to fit an elephant. Look at her – got the wrong needles, cast on too many stitches, and look at the colour – enough to blind a bat. (Critically.) I suppose you might use it to camouflage a pillar-box."
S1005203,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She must have a figure.
S1005205,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Ever thought of a tent?
S1005207,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Has she ever thought of slimming?
S1005209,P004,C0027,BROWN,,It’d make me feel bad to have to look at her. She must be a sight. No offence meant.
S1005211,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Oh, it’s alive!"
S1005213,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Listen! It can speak. No, to tell you the truth, dear, I was worried. I thought you’d passed out. I thought you’d gone into a trance. It’s this reading. She overdoes it."
S1005215,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She’s not bad. I have her on, I do. I have a good laugh. That book she’s reading – it makes me die. You didn’t really think it was about swans, did you?"
S1005216,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Listen to her! Alice O’Hara, the idiot’s friend. It’s by Proust, you nit."
S1005218,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Some of the things she tells me – that Proust is full of smut.
S1005221,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Unless she makes it all up. But she couldn’t – it’s too good.
S1005223,P004,C0027,BROWN,,They’re crude. Very crude.
S1005225,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You speak for yourself!
S1005229,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Depraved. But the way that he puts it is most entertaining.
S1005231,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You wouldn’t be entertained by anything except the Catholic Ladies’ fun book.
S1005234,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"He’s French, you nit. You’ll be making out he’s Daniel O’Proust in a minute. You Paddies are all the same."
S1005236,P004,C0027,BROWN,,André. André Proust from Montmartre. You want to ask her to read you a bit. It’d make your hair curl.
S1005238,P004,C0027,BROWN,,You ask Fazakerley.
S1005245,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I’m off duty.
S1005247,P004,C0027,BROWN,,No.
S1005249,P004,C0027,BROWN,,No.
S1005251,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I was replacing a bottle.
S1005259,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I wish someone would put her up the spout!
S1005261,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Wouldn’t I laugh? I’d laugh, I would! I’d give five years of my life to see that happen. Can’t you see the headlines"
S1005264,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Don’t talk wet!
S1005266,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Since when?
S1005268,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What an experience. I wonder he wasn’t put off his food.
S1005273,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Sister?
S1005275,P004,C0027,BROWN,,He was asleep.
S1005277,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"That’s how ulcers start, isn’t it?"
S1005279,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I daresay he wanted some. Yes.
S1005281,P004,C0027,BROWN,,It was too late.
S1005283,P004,C0027,BROWN,,I looked at the clock.
S1005284,P004,C0027,BROWN,,He’d made a good tea.
S1005286,P004,C0027,BROWN,,He didn’t ask me for any.
S1005288,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"The way she creeps about! You’ve got to hand it to her. Got any fags, Eileen?"
S1005290,P004,C0027,BROWN,,Got a match?
S1005292,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She passed through.
S1005294,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"She said nothing. You’ll have to invite her to the wedding, Eileen. Imagine her capering about with a skinful!"
S1005296,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She is.
S1005299,P004,C0027,BROWN,,She just can’t make up her mind.
S1005329,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"You’re mad. Her tips will ruin you, girl. What’s it like out?"
S1005331,P004,C0027,BROWN,,"Come on then, for Christ’s sake. I want to get out of this dump. I’m not stopping here all night. Are you coming?"
S1005333,P004,C0027,BROWN,,What’s all the rush about?
S1004373,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,It’s hot in here. Mind if I put this off? (Kicks off fire with her heel.)
S1004375,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,You couldn’t get a job making beds!
S1004525,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,I’m not.
S1004527,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,You wouldn’t be interested.
S1005154,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,Is there a cup of tea left for me? (She sits down and opens her book.)
S1005180,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,Do you mind? I’m trying to read.
S1005212,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,"Did you say anything, Brown?"
S1005293,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,I suppose she wondered where I was?
S1005300,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,What?
S1005315,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,Are you all right?
S1005317,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,You don’t want anything?
S1005321,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,No?
S1005323,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,You’re right there.
S1005325,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,Don’t tease him. He looks –
S1005327,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,I wouldn’t have had this happen for all the world –
S1005334,P004,C0028,FAZAKERLEY,,It’s number three – he’s passed out! She’s playing merry hell in there. You can say you were washing up. Quick!
S1004542,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,No.
S1004544,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,It isn’t.
S1005081,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Not for ten minutes. Who were you talking about?
S1005083,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Just now.
S1005085,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Which one?
S1005087,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,SISTER MARQUAND
S1005089,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"Here, let me make you more comfortable. (Plumps up her pillow.) That’s better. Makes all the difference."
S1005091,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,What’s the matter with her?
S1005093,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,The sister.
S1005095,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,But you do.
S1005097,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Yes.
S1005099,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,There are quite a few. I prefer them really.
S1005101,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,The men are very tight-fisted. They wouldn’t give you a smile. That Dr Barnes is a lovely woman.
S1005103,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"So kind, so gentle. And so considerate. She’s the only one here that’s worth anything."
S1005105,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Not long.
S1005107,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Er – yes.
S1005109,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Yes.
S1005111,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,What wedding would that be?
S1005113,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"No, I never saw any of them. I only last week came onto this ward."
S1005116,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I am.
S1005118,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"I will, don’t worry. I’m going off duty after tea."
S1005120,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,It is.
S1005122,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Some of them …
S1005124,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,No.
S1005127,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I thought that was Sister.
S1005129,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I wouldn’t laugh.
S1005131,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Don’t excite yourself!
S1005133,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,You know what the doctor said.
S1005135,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I must go now.
S1005140,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"Oh, shut up."
S1005142,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Have you done?
S1005145,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Have you finished?
S1005147,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,After tea.
S1005150,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,That Mrs Platt caught me.
S1005153,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"Ever since they put Sister Marquand on this ward, it’s been like Bedlam. She’s even getting on the visitors’ nerves."
S1005155,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Yes.
S1005156,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,A bit.
S1005158,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,It’s suddenly come to me what it means.
S1005160,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Last night. All of a sudden it hit me between the eyes.
S1005164,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I keep myself to myself.
S1005170,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,The baby.
S1005172,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,"I know what these society tarts do, but I wouldn’t dream of it. I must get married."
S1005174,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,He’s asked me often enough.
S1005176,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,There is. I don’t know whether I love him.
S1005182,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I wish I could make up my mind.
S1005184,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I could never marry a man I don’t love. And then living in married quarters …
S1005186,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,He’s in the army.
S1005189,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Why?
S1005191,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,He’s got nice eyes.
S1005197,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Eighteen.
S1005200,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,Would you?
S1005260,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,That’ll be the day.
S1005289,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,You had my last.
S1005298,P004,C0029,CAMERON,,I don’t know.
S1004548,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Eh?
S1004550,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Yes, she’s made my bed. She made it this morning. Well, she’s made it several times since."
S1004552,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"She comes up to me and says, ‘Here, let’s make you comfortable.’ She’s done it several times – maybe six."
S1004554,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Eh? (Removes his earphones.)
S1004556,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004558,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004560,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Why?
S1004562,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004564,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I felt a bit under the weather.
S1004566,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They’ve had second thoughts then about your pipe?
S1004568,P004,C0022,BASSET,,First they tell you one thing and then another. How’s that? Eh? How’s that? You don’t know whether you’re on your head or your heels with them half the time.
S1004570,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"No, it’s because you’re better."
S1004572,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I expect so.
S1004574,P004,C0022,BASSET,,That was heart.
S1004576,P004,C0022,BASSET,,He’d always had trouble with it.
S1004578,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(putting on his earphones again) You want to be careful. She’ll sue you for libel.
S1004580,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No. (Pause.) There was a nice play on yesterday.
S1004582,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You were asleep.
S1004584,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Yes, it was better than that Third Programme she’s always got on."
S1004586,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She’s fond of the classics.
S1004588,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Music.
S1004590,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Classical.
S1004592,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She wouldn’t like that.
S1004594,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Very.
S1004596,P004,C0022,BASSET,,When you were asleep. About five.
S1004598,P004,C0022,BASSET,,That the one who comes in to see you? (KEMP  nods.) Is she your eldest?
S1004600,P004,C0022,BASSET,,The eldest living?
S1004602,P004,C0022,BASSET,,How many more did you have?
S1004604,P004,C0022,BASSET,,A big family.
S1004606,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It was the conditions.
S1004608,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You had a struggle to bring them up then.
S1004610,P004,C0022,BASSET,,What was it?
S1004612,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Must have been. What happened about your daughter?
S1004614,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She’d set her heart on the singing then?
S1004616,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004618,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You hear so many stories. You can’t believe half of them.
S1004620,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004622,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It must have been a hard custom.
S1004624,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I can believe it.
S1004626,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"No, I didn’t."
S1004628,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It’s different now.
S1004630,P004,C0022,BASSET,,What happened to this daughter of yours?
S1004632,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She’d need to be.
S1004634,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Nothing.
S1004636,P004,C0022,BASSET,,What happened then?
S1004638,P004,C0022,BASSET,,There was yesterday.
S1004640,P004,C0022,BASSET,,There were three little girls in this play.
S1004642,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"No, as I remember one of them was a boy."
S1004644,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(ignoring this) They had white dresses on.
S1004646,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004648,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t know.
S1004650,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004652,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It didn’t say.
S1004654,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It was about this Major –
S1004656,P004,C0022,BASSET,,He’d been in the army some time previous.
S1004658,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes. He took them back to his house and locked them up in a cupboard.
S1004660,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004662,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"No, it was on the spur of the moment."
S1004664,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They got out through a door in the back.
S1004666,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004668,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004673,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004675,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It never occurred to me.
S1004677,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004679,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Nobody said anything.
S1004681,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t know. I don’t expect so.
S1004683,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I forget.
S1004685,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I can’t remember.
S1004687,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004689,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Yes, I had two."
S1004691,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004693,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004715,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Nurse!
S1004717,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Can you switch the wireless over? It’s on the Third.
S1004719,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Oh. Then it can’t be. I thought it was.
S1004721,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(after a pause) Have you tried those pills for your movements?
S1004723,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Ever tried Monastery Herbs?
S1004725,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"I’m a believer in herbs. Look at the Gypsies. When they feel in need, they just dig up a herb or two. I swear by herbs."
S1004727,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Brushless.
S1004729,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Things were different in those days.
S1004731,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Nothing.
S1004733,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It’s dead.
S1004735,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You must know. You must have been told.
S1004737,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I know she did.
S1004739,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t think so.
S1004770,P004,C0022,BASSET,,What?
S1004772,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004776,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004779,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Have you?
S1004781,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She’s a lovely woman.
S1004784,P004,C0022,BASSET,,That’s right.
S1004786,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Forty-five.
S1004790,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(indignantly) A picker!
S1004792,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I should just think it is. (Proudly.) At the Ashburton Road Refuse Disposal Depot.
S1004794,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I’ve been working inside for the past few years.
S1004796,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004798,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You’re right there.
S1004800,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Rags, mostly."
S1004802,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Old furniture covers, scraps of dress material, worn-out dish-cloths."
S1004804,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They fetch up to thirteen quid a ton.
S1004806,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Then there’s the paper.
S1004808,P004,C0022,BASSET,,If it’s clean.
S1004810,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Definitely.
S1004812,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They make every effort to eliminate it.
S1004814,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"No, I don’t mind. (Pause.) Funny chaps, some of them."
S1004816,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004818,P004,C0022,BASSET,,It’s their work makes them.
S1004820,P004,C0022,BASSET,,What?
S1004822,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(dangerously) You’re the second person who’s asked me that question today.
S1004824,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Baths. That’s all they can think about.
S1004826,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Who says I would?
S1004828,P004,C0022,BASSET,,We keep clean.
S1004830,P004,C0022,BASSET,,We’re as clean as the next man!
S1004831,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Baths, baths, baths all the time. Anybody’d think you pong. (Pause.) I don’t pong. Do I?"
S1004833,P004,C0022,BASSET,,The general public know practically nothing.
S1004835,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004837,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Clean? Yes, of course they’re clean."
S1004839,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They’re new.
S1004841,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004843,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Do I smell?
S1004845,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Just because you’re a picker, they think that you smell. A picker isn’t an ordinary dustman. I don’t smell."
S1004847,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t smell.
S1004851,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t need one.
S1004853,P004,C0022,BASSET,,You can’t force me.
S1004855,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004857,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004859,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I didn’t think.
S1004861,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Yes.
S1004863,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I don’t know.
S1004865,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I haven’t examined them.
S1004867,P004,C0022,BASSET,,They may be.
S1004869,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Tomorrow.
S1004871,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004873,P004,C0022,BASSET,,She can’t be contacted.
S1004881,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I’m not against it.
S1004885,P004,C0022,BASSET,,(with the thermometer in his mouth) Me arteries won’t let the blood through.
S1004887,P004,C0022,BASSET,,"Besides that, I don’t smell. Do I?"
S1004891,P004,C0022,BASSET,,No.
S1004893,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I threw it away.
S1004894,P004,C0022,BASSET,,I can’t think clearly.
S1004896,P004,C0022,BASSET,,Out of the window.
S1005337,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(turning at the desk) Take a seat. Is this your first job?
S1005338,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(picking up a pencil) I’m going to ask you a few questions. (He hands her a notebook and pencil.) Write them down. In English, please. (He returns to his desk, sits, smiles.) Who was your father? Put that at the head of the page."
S1005340,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"I’d better be frank, Miss Barclay. I can’t employ you if you’re in any way miraculous. It would be contrary to established practice. You did have a father?"
S1005342,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,If you had a father why can’t you produce him?
S1005344,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(shrewdly) Was she a nun?
S1005346,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Pass that large, leather-bound volume, will you? I must check your story. To safeguard my interests, you understand?"
S1005348,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(opening the book, running his finger down the page.) Ah, here we are! It’s a building of small architectural merit built for some unknown purpose at the turn of the century. It was converted into a hotel by public subscription. (He nods, wisely.) I stayed there once myself as a young man. It has a reputation for luxury which baffles the most undemanding guest. (He closes the book with a bang and pushes it to one side.) Your story appears, in the main, to be correct. This admirable volume, of course, omits most of the details. But that is only to be expected in a publication of wide general usage. (He puts on his spectacles.) Make a note to the effect that your father is missing. Say nothing of the circumstances. It might influence my final decision."
S1005349,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Is your mother alive? Or has she too unaccountably vanished? That is a trick question. Be careful – you could lose marks on your final scoring.
S1005351,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,From what cause?
S1005353,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Have you applied for compensation?
S1005355,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Were there no other victims of the disaster?
S1005357,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Which parts?
S1005359,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Surely the Churchill family did that?
S1005361,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,You’ve had a unique experience. It’s not everyone has their step-mother assassinated by the North Thames Gas Board.
S1005363,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Your caution does you credit, my dear. (He smiles in a kindly fashion.) Now, I have to ask a question which may cause you embarrassment. Please remember that I’m a doctor. (Pause.) What is your shorthand speed?"
S1005365,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,And your typing speed?
S1005367,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Perhaps you have other qualities which aren’t immediately apparent. Lie on that couch.
S1005369,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Never ask questions. That is the first lesson a secretary must learn. (He pulls aside the curtains on the couch.) And kindly remove your stockings. I wish to see what effect your step-mother’s death had upon your legs.
S1005371,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Have no fear, Miss Barclay. What I see upon the couch isn’t a lovely and desirable girl. It’s a sick mind in need of psychiatric treatment. The body is of no interest to a man of my stamp. A woman once threw herself at me. I needn’t tell you that this is spoken in confidence. She was stark naked. She wished me to misbehave myself. And, d’you know, all I was conscious of was that she had a malformed navel? That’s how much notice I take of women’s bodies."
S1005373,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,As I thought. You’ve a febrile condition of the calves. You’re quite wise to have a check-up. (He straightens and takes off his spectacles.) Undress.
S1005375,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I shall take account of your inexperience in these matters.
S1005377,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I shall wear rubber gloves.
S1005379,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,If your reactions are normal you’ll be back on your feet in next to no time.
S1005381,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,The chapter dealing with medical examinations may have been omitted from the text.
S1005383,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Your concern is well-founded, Miss Barclay. Our educational system needs thoroughly looking into. Speak to your headmistress at her next ‘old girls’ get-together’."
S1005385,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Mrs PRENTICE
S1005387,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"I haven’t the patience, my dear. I’ve a natural tendency to rush things. I won’t trouble you with the details of my private life till you’re dressed."
S1005388,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Put your clothes on the chair provided.
S1005390,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"My wife is a nymphomaniac. Consequently, like the Holy Grail, she’s ardently sought after by young men. I married her for her money and, upon discovering her to be penniless, I attempted to throttle her. She escaped my murderous fury and I’ve had to live with her malice ever since."
S1005391,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Well, my dear, if it’ll give you any pleasure you can test my new contraceptive device."
S1005392,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(with an indulgent, superior smile) Lie on the couch with your hands behind your head and think of the closing chapters of your favourite work of fiction. The rest may be left to me."
S1005396,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(flushing, guilty) I must ask you not to enter my consulting-room without warning. You’re interrupting my studies."
S1005399,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I was dictating a message to Matron. She’s worried by her inability to control her bladder.
S1005401,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,My theory is still in the planning stage. I’d rather not discuss it.
S1005403,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Why have you returned? You know I can’t endure the torment of being in your company.
S1005407,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Well, I’m sure you’re the best judge of that."
S1005428,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(to Nick) She’ll be sodden before long. (He puts the case down.)
S1005430,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"No. My wife said breast-feeding would spoil her shape. Though, from what I remember, it would’ve been improved by a little nibbling."
S1005432,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"She’s an example of in-breeding among the lobelia-growing classes. A failure in eugenics, combined with a taste for alcohol and sexual intercourse, makes it most undesirable for her to become a mother."
S1005434,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,You were born with your legs apart. They’ll send you to the grave in a Y-shaped coffin.
S1005436,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(stuffily) I never take pills.
S1005438,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,How dare you say that! Your book on the climax in the female is largely autobiographical. (Pause. He stares.) Or have you been masquerading as a sexually responsive woman?
S1005440,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(looking after her) What a discovery! Married to a mistress of the fraudulent climax. (He pours himself a drink.)
S1005441,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,As a psychiatrist I do all I can to bring estranged couples together. (He presses money into Nick’s hand.) Don’t hesitate to call on me if you’re mentally disturbed.
S1005442,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"It’s no good lying there, Miss Barclay. My wife has returned."
S1005444,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,The examination is cancelled until further notice. (He picks up the underclothes from the chair.) Get dressed!
S1005447,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes. I’ve got her particulars somewhere.
S1005450,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,A man could never get used to the work.
S1005452,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I couldn’t ask a young fellow to do overtime and then palm him off with a lipstick or a bottle of Yardley’s. It’d be silk suits and Alfa Romeos if I so much as breathed on him.
S1005454,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,What will become of Miss Barclay? I’ve already given her a preliminary interview.
S1005458,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(pause) It’s an old one of yours.
S1005460,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Our marriage is like the peace of God – it passeth all understanding.
S1005463,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(reluctant) May I have the one you’re wearing in exchange?
S1005465,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Why aren’t you wearing a dress? Are you following some extreme fashion?
S1005467,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,It doesn’t sound the kind of behaviour one expects at a four-star hotel.
S1005469,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(joining her at the desk) Do you realize what would happen if your adventures became public? I’d be ruined. The doors of London society would be slammed in my face. (He pours a whisky.) Did you inform the authorities of this escapade?
S1005471,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Why not?
S1005473,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,IS there a market for illegal entRANCE
S1005475,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,What other qualifications has he?
S1005477,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,There aren’t many jobs for male typists.
S1005479,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,How do you hope to employ him?
S1005481,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,She’s upstairs.
S1005483,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Could I borrow one of your dresses for a while, my dear?"
S1005485,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"She’ll bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave. (He goes to the couch, pulls curtain aside, and looks through.) Miss Barclay – the present situation is fraught with danger my wife is under the impression that your dress belongs to her."
S1005487,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I’m afraid that is impossible. You must be patient for a little longer.
S1005489,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(a tremor passing across his face) Indeed I do, Miss Barclay. I’m sure it must cause you acute embarrassment. I’ll set about finding you suitable clothing."
S1005490,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes. Have you an appointment?
S1005492,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes. But it’s highly confidential. My files are never open to strangers.
S1005494,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(worried, taking off his spectacles) Which branch?"
S1005496,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Do you cover asylums proper? Or just houses of tentative madness?
S1005498,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,You’re obviously a force to be reckoned with.
S1005500,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(swallowing drink) Yes.
S1005502,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes. (He pours another whisky.) We have him here as a patient from time to time.
S1005503,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No. It’s perfectly useless for anything – except to let light in.
S1005504,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(with a wary smile) I do double consultations. Toddlers are often terrified of a doctor. So I’ve taken to examining their mothers at the same time.
S1005506,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I don’t approve of scientists who publicize their theories.
S1005509,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"It’s a prescription, sir."
S1005510,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I can claim to have had some success with it.
S1005512,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"She’s a patient, sir. I’d just managed to calm her down when you arrived."
S1005514,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes.
S1005516,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Miss Barclay, a gentleman wishes to speak to you."

S1005519,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No.
S1005521,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,The committal order hasn’t yet been signed.

S1005535,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"No, sir. Her step-mother died recently after a remarkably intimate involvement with Sir Winston Churchill."
S1005537,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,He appears to have been an unpleasant fellow. He made her mother pregnant at her place of employment.

S1005550,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"She’s taken my secretary’s name as her ‘nom-de-folie’. Although morally reprehensible, there’s little we can do legally, I’m afraid."
S1005552,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"My wife is unfamiliar with the habits of young women, sir. I’ve known many who could vanish into thin air. And some who took a delight in doing so."
S1005554,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes.
S1005556,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,She may have done.
S1005566,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"It’s a fascinating theory, sir, and cleverly put together. Does it tie in with known facts?"
S1005568,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No.
S1005570,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No.
S1005572,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,There’s a perfectly rational explanation for what is taking place. Keep calm. All will be well.
S1005574,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Perhaps there’s a simpler explanation for the apparent complexities of the case, sir."
S1005578,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(his back to her, strangled) Yes. Get me a glass of water."
S1005581,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No. I’ll be all right.
S1005583,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I wonder if you’d get another glass? That one is quite the wrong shape.
S1005585,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Yes.
S1005588,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(lifting his hands) Praying.
S1005590,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(drinking water) Perhaps he’d call back later. I’m still feeling dicky.
S1005592,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Is that why he took to rape?
S1005594,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Two decades spent fighting her and a receding hairline! I’ve had just about enough of both.
S1005596,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(shocked) Was it quite wise to do that, sir? Is it in accord with the present enlightened approach to the mentally sick?"
S1005598,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,And you were his prize pupil?
S1005600,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Where are they now?
S1005602,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Running them?
S1005606,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(To Dr Rance) A prospective employee, sir. It’s useless to claim that Socialism has had no effect."
S1005610,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,A spaniel and a miniature poodle.
S1005613,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No-don’t do that. Miss Barclay is quite safe. She’s downstairs. I’ve just remembered.
S1005614,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,It’d slipped my memory.
S1005616,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I can’t remember.
S1005618,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I may have had a blackout. I don’t recall having one on any other occasion.
S1005620,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"I can only state what I know, sir. I can’t be expected to remember things I’ve forgotten."

S1005678,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I can’t allow you to disturb her. She has work to do.
S1005680,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,She’s in the garden.

S1005719,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,A dress? I’ll take possession of that. (He takes the box from her.)
S1005721,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Don’t raise your voice. Take a biscuit from the barrel and retire to your room.
S1005724,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"That’s a filthy habit and, in my opinion, very injurious to the health."
S1005726,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,We have an overall moral policy in this clinic from which even I am not exempt. Whilst you’re with us I shall expect you to show an interest in no one’s sexual organs but your own.

S1005730,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,She might be in the dispensary.

S1005737,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,This paranoia is uncalled-for. The officer has probably called to ask me for the hand of my cook in marriage.

S1005741,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I’m sure you didn’t. Despite all appeaRANCE
S1005743,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(with a frown) Was there no mistress in attendance?
S1005745,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Did you disturb her?
S1005749,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,No. I’m obsessed by my own. (He wipes his brow.) We shall be sharing the same cell at this rate.
S1005750,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Certainly not! Is that what usually happens when men ask you to take your clothes off?
S1005752,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Five shillings! Good gracious the rate hasn’t changed in thirty years. What can the unions be thinking of? (He puts a hand on Nick’s shoulder.) Come along, strip!"
S1005753,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Remarkable. My last secretary couldn’t better you. And she was a descendant of Houdini.
S1005756,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I’m carrying out a medical examination.
S1005758,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(smiling, with enormous patience) My investigations upon his clothed body would be strictly ‘unscientific’ and, inevitably, superficial. In order to assure myself that he’s going to be of use to me I must examine him fully. And skinwise."
S1005761,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I have an idea. I want you to impersonate my secretary. Her name is Geraldine Barclay. It will solve all our problems if you agree to my request.

S1006202,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,It would help me considerably if you’d take your clothes off.
S1006203,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(angry, losing patience) Of course not! That’s a strait-jacket. I won’t be a party to kinky capers. You’ve lived too long at the Station Hotel to know how decent people behave. Now do as I say and undress!"

S1006270,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,(to Nick) Put that gun down! (To Dr Rance.) A husband must be allowed to put his wife into a strait-jacket. It’s one of the few pleasures left in modern marriage.

S1006274,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"(waving his gun) Stay where you are, doctor! Your conduct today has been a model of official irresponsibility and bloody-mindedness. I’m going to certify you."
S1006275,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I have the weapon. You have the choice. What is it to be? Either madness or death?
S1006277,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,That isn’t true. The higher reaches of the civil service are recruited entirely from corpses or madmen. Press the alarm!
S1006278,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,A fitting tribute to the effectiveness of our early warning system.
S1006280,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,Is this a record for you?

S1006288,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,This young man is the page-boy from the Station Hotel. He misbehaved himself with my wife. He wasn’t an hallucination when he did that.

S1006311,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,—‘To Lillian from Avis. Christmas 1939’. I found that brooch many years ago. It was on the pavement outside a large department store.
S1006313,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I’ve no idea. It fell from the collar of a pekinese. Lillian and Avis may have been the creature’s owners. (He stares about him in shame.) I haven’t seen it since I pressed it into the hand of a chambermaid whom I debauched shortly before my marriage.
S1006315,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,I wished to recreate a moment that was very precious to me. If you’d given in to my request our marriage would never have foundered.
S1006329,P005,C0030,PRENTICE,,"Well, sergeant, we have been instrumental in uncovering a number of remarkable peccadilloes today. I’m sure you’ll co-operate in keeping them out of the papers?"
S1005339,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,I’ve no idea who my father was.
S1005341,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,"Oh, I’m sure I did. My mother was frugal in her habits, but she’d never economize unwisely."
S1005343,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,He deserted my mother. Many years ago. She was the victim of an unpleasant attack.
S1005345,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,No she was a chambermaid at the Station Hotel.
S1005347,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Yes.
S1005350,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,I haven’t seen my mother for many years. I was brought up by a Mrs Barclay. She died recently.
S1005352,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,"An explosion, due to a faulty gas-main, killed her outright and took the roof off the house."
S1005354,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Just for the roof.
S1005356,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Yes. A recently erected statue of Sir Winston Churchill was so badly injured that the George medal has been talked of. Parts of the great man were actually found embedded in my step-mother.
S1005358,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,"I’m afraid I can’t help you there. I was too upset to supervise the funeral arrangements. Or, indeed, to identify the body."

S1005372,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,"Please forgive me, doctor. I wasn’t meaning to suggest that your attentions were in any way improper."
S1005374,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,I’ve never undressed in front of a man before.
S1005376,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,I couldn’t allow a man to touch me while I was unclothed.
S1005378,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,How long would I have to remain undressed?
S1005380,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,My headmistress made no mention of this in her booklet ‘Hints to the School-leaver’.

S1006258,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Dr Rance did it. He says I’m mad.

S1006262,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,She thinks she is. She imagines you’re a figment of her imagination.
S1006293,P005,C0032,Geraldine,to Dr Rance,"Mrs PRENTICE mistook my dress for her own and, by an oversight, you mistook me for a patient. Dr Prenticeasked me to keep quiet in order to protect his good name. What could I do? I was terrified of exposure."
S1006295,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Yes. Under duress I agreed to help the doctor. I’ve never ceased reproaching myself. The whole day has been spent fighting to retain my self-respect.
S1006298,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Yes. It has great sentimental value.
S1006308,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,Was our father also employed by the Station Hotel?
S1006323,P005,C0032,GERALDINE,,The undertaker.

S1005398,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,There’s no one here. Were you talking to yourself?

S1005404,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"I arrived at my meeting to find the hall in an uproar. Helen Duncanon had declared herself to be in love with a man. And, as you know, the club is primarily for lesbians. I myself am exempt from the rule because yon count as a woman. We expelled Helen and I spent the night at the Station Hotel. (She swallows her drink.)"
S1005406,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"(to DR PRENTICE) Cast your eye across my luggage, will you? Half of it has already been stolen by the hotel staff. (She turns to the table and pours a drink.) It’s so difficult being a woman."

S1005433,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(quietly) I hardly ever have sexual intercourse.
S1005435,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(with a brittle laugh) My trouble stems from your inadequacy as a lover! It’s embarrassing. You must’ve learned your technique from a Christmas cracker. (Her mouth twists into a sneer.) Rejuvenation pills have no effect on you.
S1005437,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,You take them all the time during our lovemaking. The deafening sound of your chewing is the reason for my never having an orgasm.

S1005449,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Have you ever given thought to a male secretary?
S1005451,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,My father had a male secretary. My mother said he was much better than a woman.
S1005453,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Try a boy for a change. You’re a rich man. You can afford the luxuries of life.

S1005466,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"(putting on Geraldine’s dress) I’m going to speak frankly and with complete candour. Please listen carefully and save your comments for later. (She zips up the dress.) My room at the hotel was small, airless and uncomfortable. A model of its kind. As I was dressing for dinner I noticed that the sheets on the bed were none too clean. I went to the linen cupboard, which I knew to be on the second floor, hoping to find a chambermaid. Instead I found a pageboy who enticed me into the cupboard and then made an indecent suggestion. When I repulsed him he attempted to rape me. I fought him off but not before he’d stolen my handbag and several articles of clothing."
S1005468,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,The boy has promised to return my dress. He’s sold it to a friend who probably intends using it at sex orgies.
S1005470,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,No.
S1005472,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I saw in his youth the remnants of a natural goodness that had all but been destroyed by the pressures of society. I promised to find him employment.
S1005474,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I don’t propose to lead him into a dead-end job.
S1005476,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,He can type.
S1005478,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,No. He’s been depressed by his failure in commerce. That’s why he took to rape.
S1005480,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,As your secretary. He’ll be back in an hour. You can check his credentials at your leisure. Where is Miss Barclay?
S1005482,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I shall inform her that the situation is no longer vacant.
S1005484,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"I find your sudden craving for women’s clothing a dull and, on the whole, a rather distasteful subject."

S1005545,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(anxious) Miss Barclay is nowhere to be found.
S1005551,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I shall contact the employment agency. Miss Barclay can’t have vanished into thin air.

S1005579,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,," hurries into the dispensary. Dr Prenticestares about him in desperation. He sees a tall vase of roses. He removes the roses and stuffs the underclothing and one shoe into the vase. The second shoe won’t go in. He pauses, perplexed. He is about to replace the roses when Mrs PRENTICE"
S1005580,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Put them back at once!

S1005586,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,," stares hard at him, then goes into the dispensary. Dr Prenticetries to replace the roses in the vase. They won’t go in. He picks up a pair of scissors from his desk and cuts the stalks down to within an inch or so of the heads. He puts the roses into the vase and wraps the stalks in his handkerchief and puts it into his pocket. He looks for somewhere to conceal the second shoe. He gets on his knees and shoves the shoe between the space on top of the books on the lower shelf of the bookcase. Mrs PRENTICE"
S1005587,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,What are you doing now?
S1005589,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"This puerile behaviour ill accords with your high academic standards. (She puts the glass of water down, and tosses her head.) The youth I wish you to engage as your secretary has arrived."
S1005591,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I’ll see what he says. He’s an impatient young man.

S1005608,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,None. I’ve checked with the Employment Bureau. Their clients have strict instructions to ring them immediately after an interview. Miss Barclay has failed to do so.
S1005612,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I’ll contact the warden. He has charge of the gate and will know whether she left the building. (She turns to go.)
S1005621,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,What’s Miss Barclay doing downstairs?
S1005632,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, goes to the desk and pours herself a whisky.
S1005633,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"(with a half-smile) My husband is a strange person, doctor. Is he a genius or merely a highly-strung fool?"

S1005644,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, takes the cuttings book back to the bookcase and attempts to put the book away. She is unable to do so. She investigates. She discovers Geraldine’s shoe and looks at it in amazement.
S1005645,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,What a thing to find in a bookcase!

S1005652,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(pause) You’re quite right. (She dabs at her nose with a handkerchief.) I’ve known for some time that all was not well. I’ve tried to convince myself that my fears were groundless. All the while I knew I was cheating myself.
S1005653,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"Oh, I think his boorish attitude towards my mother. He used to ring her up and suggest painful ways of committing suicide. Worn out at last by his pestering she took his advice."
S1005655,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"Oh, yes. Quite definitely, doctor. He had no sympathy for me when I complained of being assaulted by a page-boy at the Station Hotel."
S1005657,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,The youth wanted to rape me.
S1005659,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,No.
S1005660,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Shortly after my return my husband started having the most extraordinary ideas which I’d’ve been willing to indulge if they hadn’t overstepped the bounds of good taste.

S1005663,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"I refused to loan him any of mine and went in search of Miss Barclay. Some time later, in my presence, my husband had a kind of fit. He asked me to get him a drink. When I returned he presented me with a bouquet of flowers."
S1005665,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I’d only been to the dispensary. And he’d taken the flowers from the vase. (She points to the vase.) I was angry and not a little frightened. At this point a spasm of agony crossed his otherwise tranquil features. I offered him the glass of water. He reacted in a violent manner. He said the glass was the wrong shape.
S1005667,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I returned to the dispensary. When I got back he was on his knees praying.
S1005669,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"(dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief) Oh, doctor, you’ve no idea what a relief it’s been to talk to someone like yourself."
S1005671,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,A woman doesn’t like facing the fact that the man she loves is insane. It makes her look such a fool.

S1005769,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Your actions grow wilder with every passing moment. Why were you rude to the policeman?

S1005773,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,," goes into the hall. Dr Prenticereplaces the flowers, goes to his desk and pours a large whisky. Geraldine enters from the ward. Her hair has been cut short. She is wearing the hospital nightgown. Dr Prenticeis considerably alarmed by her presence in the room."

S1006064,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(putting ice into her glass) I don’t know. When I returned from telephoning the Station Hotel he was undressing the sergeant.
S1006066,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"Strange and, in many ways, puzzling. He’s called him into this room on several occasions and then abruptly dismissed him."
S1006068,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,None. Except that this looks like the nightgown she was wearing. (She holds up Geraldine’s nightgown.)
S1006070,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Yes.
S1006072,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,They state that they have no page called Gerald Barclay on their register. The youth you’ve certified insane must be an impostor.
S1006074,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,He hasn’t returned to the hotel. Yet when he disappeared his uniform was in my possession.
S1006075,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"Oh, doctor! Does any of this make sense to you?"
S1006077,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,And why did he assault the policeman?
S1006079,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,How long do you think my husband has been insane?
S1006081,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(drinking whisky with a shudder) What a dreadful story. I’d condemn it in the strongest terms if it were fiction.
S1006083,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, picks a bright red pill-box from the floor near the couch. Dr Rance is quick to notice.

S1006086,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, gasps with shock and amazement.

S1006096,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Someone has stolen the sergeant’s helmet from the hall table. Do you suppose it could be my husband?

S1006140,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Why not?
S1006142,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, smiles a smile of quiet disbelief.
S1006143,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"If we’re to save our marriage, my dear, you must admit that you prefer boys to women. Dr Rance has explained the reasons for your aberration. You’ll find me quite tolerant. In fact I know a number of charming youths. I could pass a few of the younger ones on to you. It would raise the tone of our marriage considerably."
S1006145,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(tossing her head) The page at the hotel accused you of behaving in an indecent manner.
S1006147,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Admit that you prefer your sex to mine. I’ve no hesitation in saying that I do.

S1006150,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(eagerly) Are you going to beat me? Do if you wish. Your psychotic experiences are immensely valuable to you and should be encouraged rather than thwarted or repressed.

S1006153,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"(rising, stumbling to the desk) Oh, doctor, during your absence my husband became violent and struck me. (She pours a whisky.)"

S1006220,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, hurries into the dispensary. A cry and a crash are heard and Geraldine runs out. She has taken off the uniform and wears her own panties and bra.
S1006225,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, steps back.
S1006226,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, goes into the dispensary.
S1006233,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,, enters from the dispensary carrying a hypodermic syringe and bowl.
S1006234,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,What is the meaning of this exhibition?
S1006235,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Your treatment seems designed to plunge the patient deeper into lunacy rather than achieve any lasting cure.

S1006244,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,There’s a policeman outside. Naked and covered in blood.

S1006248,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Can you see it?
S1006250,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,Then what explanation is there?

S1006301,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"Let me see those pieces of jewellery. (The two brooches are shown to her.) A single brooch can be made of these two fragments. (She fits the brooch together. Oh, my heart is beating like a wild thing!)"
S1006303,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"It belonged to me once. Many years ago, when I was a young woman, I was raped in a linen cupboard on the second floor of the Station Hotel. As the man left me he pressed that brooch into my hands in part payment."
S1006305,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,"I paid for my misdemeanour by conceiving twins. It was impossible for me to keep them – I was by then engaged to be married to a promising young psychiatrist. I decided to abandon them to their fate. I broke the brooch in half and pinned a separate piece to each babe. I then placed them at either end of the small country town in which I was resident. Some kind people must’ve brought the children up as their own. (Weeping, hugging Nick and Geraldine.) Oh, children! I am your mother! Can you ever forgive me for what I did?"
S1006307,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I was employed as a chambermaid. I did it for a joke shortly after the war. The effect of a Labour Government on the middle-classes had to be seen to be believed.
S1006309,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,I never saw your father. The incident occurred during a power-cut. I became pregnant as I waited for normal service to be resumed.
S1006314,P005,C0031,MRS PRENTICE,,(with a cry of recognition) I understand now why you suggested that we spend our wedding night in a linen cupboard!

S1005410,P005,C0033,NICK,,I’ve already sold the dress for a lump sum. I could get it back at a price. I’ve also found someone to take an option on the photographs.
S1005412,P005,C0033,NICK,,I had a camera concealed in the room.
S1005414,P005,C0033,NICK,,I’d like a hundred quid for the negatives. You’ve got until lunchtime.

S1005418,P005,C0033,NICK,,You didn’t behave like a married woman last night.
S1005420,P005,C0033,NICK,,You must be more careful in your choice of friends. I’d like to get out of the indecent photograph racket. It’s so wearing on the nerves. Can you find me a worthwhile job? I had a hard boyhood.

S1005742,P005,C0033,NICK,,"Undeterred I took the lift to the third floor of the hotel where a party of schoolgirls were staying. Oh, sir, what lonely and aimless lives they lead!"
S1005744,P005,C0033,NICK,,She occupied a room across the corridor.
S1005746,P005,C0033,NICK,,"No. And she’ll never forgive me for it. It was she who reported the incident to the police. Oh, sir! Don’t turn me over to the law."
S1005748,P005,C0033,NICK,,Have you given a thought to my predicament?
S1005751,P005,C0033,NICK,,Yes. They give me five shillings.

After a short conversation during which we discussed sex matters in an uninhibited and free-wheeling way, he asked me if I’d mind dressing up as a woman. I agreed to his suggestion having heard that transvestism is no longer held to be a dangerous debilitating vice. The doctor introduced me to his colleagues as ‘Miss Barclay’.

S1005555,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Well, PRENTICE"
S1005557,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I see. A definite pattern is beginning to emerge.
S1005559,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Did he assault you?
S1005564,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"I’m interested in rape, Miss Barclay, not the aesthetics of cross-examination. Answer me, please! Were you molested by your father?"
S1005565,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"The vehemence of her denials is proof positive of guilt. It’s a text-book case! A man beyond innocence, a girl aching for experience. The beauty, confusion and urgency of their passion driving them on. They embark on a reckless love-affair. He finds it difficult to reconcile his guilty secret with his spiritual convictions. It preys on his mind. Sexual activity ceases. She, who basked in his love, feels anxiety at its loss. She seeks advice from her priest. The Church, true to Her ancient traditions, counsels chastity. The result – madness."
S1005567,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,That need not cause us undue anxiety. Civilizations have been founded and maintained on theories which refused to obey facts. As far as I’m concerned this child was unnaturally assaulted by her own father. I shall base my future actions upon that assumption.
S1005573,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"It’s also obvious to the meanest amateur, PRENTICE"
S1005575,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Simple explanations are for simple minds. I’ve no use for either. (He pushes the trolley towards the ward door.) Open the door. I shall supervise the cutting of the patient’s hair.
S1005595,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"You’ll have no trouble recognizing the patient, PRENTICE"
S1005597,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Perfectly in accord. I’ve published a monograph on the subject. I wrote it at University. On the advice of my tutor. A remarkable man. Having failed to achieve madness himself he took to teaching it to others.
S1005599,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,There were some more able than I.
S1005601,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,In mental institutions.
S1005603,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,For the most part.
S1005607,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,to Mrs PRENTICE,Is there no news of Miss Barclay?
S1005609,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,A search party must be organized. (To DR PRENTICE.) What have you in the way of dogs?
S1005611,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Let them be unleashed! Geraldine Barclay must be found or the authorities informed.
S1005615,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Have you suffered from lapses of memory before?
S1005617,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your memory plays you false even on the subject of its own inadequacy?
S1005619,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You might have forgotten. You admit your memory isn’t reliable.
S1005624,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"You claim, PRENTICE"
S1005626,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I can hardly credit it. Once seen a white golliwog is not easily forgotten. What was the object in creating these nightmare creatures?
S1005628,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,These hellish white homuncules must be put out of their misery. I order you to destroy them before their baleful influence can make itself felt.
S1005631,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,The man’s a second Frankenstein.
S1005634,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I’d like to know him better before I ventured an opinion. Have there been other schemes besides this golliwog scandal?
S1005637,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your husband’s behaviour gives me cause for grave disquiet. Are you yourself convinced that his methods can result in a lessening of tension between the sane and the insane?
S1005639,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"In this he appears to succeed only too well. (He faces her, candidly.) Never have I seen matters conducted as they are in this house."
S1005641,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your husband is using dangerously unorthodox methods in his treatment of the insane. (He goes to his briefcase and puts the note away.)
S1005647,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Let me see it.
S1005648,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,," I must ask you to be honest with me, Mrs PRENTICE, Has Dr Prenticeat any time given you cause to doubt his own sanity?"
S1005651,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Radical thought comes easily to the lunatic.
S1005654,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"And more recently, say from this morning, has there been an increase in his condition?"
S1005656,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,What was the object of the assault?
S1005658,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,He didn’t succeed?
S1005661,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Give me an example.
S1005664,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,He wished to congratulate you on your safe return.
S1005666,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,What a revealing phrase!
S1005668,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,How shocking! His abnormal condition has driven him to seek refuge in religion. Always the last ditch stand of a man on the brink of disaster. (He pats Mrs PRENTICE
S1005670,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Why haven’t you done so before?
S1005673,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You guilty scientists will destroy the world with your shameful secrets. (He takes Geraldine’s shoe from his briefcase.) Does this belong to your secretary?
S1005677,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Where is this secretary of yours? I’ve a few questions I’d like to put to her.
S1005679,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"I don’t think you quite appreciate the position, PRENTICE"
S1005681,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Ask her to step this way.
S1005683,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Very well. (Tight-lipped.) I shall seek her out myself. You may be sure, PRENTICE"
S1005729,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"I can find no trace of your secretary. I might add, PRENTICE"
S1005731,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Unless I discover her whereabouts within the next few minutes you’ll find yourself in serious trouble.
S1005747,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"I warn you, PRENTICE"
S1005851,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,PRENTICE
S1005853,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Only a few minutes.
S1005855,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,She must’ve come through this room. You and I were in the garden. Mrs PRENTICE:  was in the hall. Escape would be impossible. She must still be in this room. (He turns to Dr Prenticein triumph.) Only one hiding place is possible.
S1005889,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Full security arrangements are in force. No one is to leave the clinic without written permission. PRENTICE
S1005893,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Now, PRENTICE"
S1005896,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,It’s no good trying to do that. Boys cannot be put in the club. That’s half their charm.
S1005898,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You should consult a qualified psychiatrist.
S1005900,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"You’re a fool. That isn’t quite the same thing. Though, in your case, the two may have much in common. (To Sergeant Match.) Has the boy come to your notice before?"
S1005903,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Ruin follows the accusation not the vice. Had you committed the act you wouldn’t now be facing the charge.
S1005905,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I wish you wouldn’t use these Chaucerian words. It’s most confusing. (To Sergeant Match.) How do you propose to get to the bottom of this affair?
S1005912,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,And I shall conduct it. The mind of the victim of this kind of assault must be considered equally with the body.
S1005914,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Then why make such a foul accusation?
S1005916,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Yes. We can’t be too careful.
S1005919,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,We’ve no privileged class here. It’s democratic lunacy we practise.
S1005922,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You enjoyed the experience? (He puts the towel aside and pulls on rubber gloves.) Would you enjoy normal intercourse?
S1005924,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,He’s just given away a vital piece of information. (He advances on Geraldine.) Do you think of yourself as a girl?
S1005926,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Why not?
S1005929,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You wish to remain in ignoRANCE
S1005931,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I can’t encourage you in such a self-indulgent attitude. You must face facts like the rest of us.
S1005933,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,This is a mental home. He couldn’t choose a more appropriate place. (To Geraldine.) Undress. My time is valuable.
S1005935,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,How does it help a man if a girl pretends to be a boy?
S1005937,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,But boys are fair game? I doubt whether your very personal view of Society would go unchallenged.
S1005940,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,If he’s going to carry on like this he’ll have to be strapped down.
S1005943,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,How about in front of a man?
S1005945,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I wonder if I could tempt her. (He chews his lip.) I’ll give it a try. She may be a nymphomaniac. (To DR PRENTICE.) If this lad becomes foul-mouthed keep him on the boil till I return.
S1005953,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your secretary is standing on a table fighting off any attempt to undress her. She seems incapable of conducting herself in a proper manner.
S1005955,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"But you expect a secretary to misbehave herself. It’s a condition of employment. (He faces DR PRENTICE, candidly.) Do you realize the woman uses a razor?"
S1005957,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,From her chin? (He flings the rubber gloves aside.) There are two sexes. The unpalatable truth must be faced. Your attempts at a merger can end only in heartbreak.
S1005961,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,But your condition is worse than hers.
S1005963,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"No madman ever accepts madness. Only the sane do that. (To Nick, brusquely.) Why won’t you allow Mrs PRENTICE"
S1005966,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Was it an autographed copy?
S1005968,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Well, of course, these things slip one’s memory. Was there an inscription?"
S1005970,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,What did it say?
S1005972,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Oh, they count as God. You’ve clearly had a genuine religious experience. (He nods to Geraldine.) Were you present when Dr Prenticeused this youth unnaturally?"
S1005974,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,to Mrs PRENTICE,") How disturbing the questions of the mad can be. (To Nick.) Suppose I made an indecent suggestion to you? If you agreed something might occur which, by and large, would be regarded as natural. If, on the other hand, I approached this child – (He smiles at Geraldine.) – my action could result only in a gross violation of the order of things."
S1005976,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,It’s impossible to say with any degree of accuracy. He refuses to co-operate with a medical examination.
S1005980,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,This is the boy he undressed.
S1005985,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"How would you describe a man who mauls young boys, importunes policemen and lives on terms of intimacy with a woman who shaves twice a day?"
S1005987,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I’m glad you’re beginning to face the realities of the situation. (To Geraldine.) Who are you if you’re not Nicholas Beckett?
S1005990,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,What has happened then to Nicholas Beckett?
S1005994,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,Mrs PRENTICE,) I hope we haven’t lost another one. We’ll be alone with our miracle drugs if many more go. Find out whether the boy has returned to the hotel.
S1005998,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I’m relieving you of your post as head of this clinic. You’ll do as I say from now on.
S1006000,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I doubt whether the views of a madman will carry much weight with the Commissioners.
S1006002,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your actions today would get the Archbishop of Canterbury declared non-compos.
S1006004,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,That will come at a later stage of your illness.
S1006006,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Bearing in mind your abnormality that is a normal reaction. The sane appear as strange to the mad as the mad to the sane. Remain where you are. I shall give you a capsule.
S1006023,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Take two of these.
S1006025,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Dangerous drugs intended to relieve your pathologically elevated mood. Be careful not to exceed the stated dose. (To Nick.) Get a grip on yourself, young woman, and release those objects for which the police of five counties are searching. (He takes Geraldine by the arm.) I’m putting this youth into a padded cell. Rampant hermaphroditism must be discouraged."
S1006061,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,A man shouldn’t have to drug his wife in order to achieve a happy union.
S1006063,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your depraved appetities may have contributed in part to your husband’s breakdown. Where is DR PRENTICE?
S1006065,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,How would you describe his relations with the sergeant?
S1006067,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Playing the coquette, eh? Well, well, it adds spice to a love affair. What news of the patient?"
S1006069,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,She must be naked then?
S1006071,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,And what’s the report from the Station Hotel?
S1006073,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,And what of Nicholas Beckett – the real page-boy?
S1006076,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"It most certainly does. It’s a human interest story. A respected member of the medical fraternity is married to a dazzlingly beautiful woman. Hopelessly in love but, through mutual distrust, refusing to admit it, there is little they can do to prevent a once-precious relationship turning sour. The doctor has a charming, but mentally unstable patient. She is the key to the mystery. At an early age she was the victim of a sexual attack. The assailant was her own father! An act of transference, common to the experience of any psychiatrist, allows her to identify the doctor as her parent. The demands of a nymphomaniac wife and patient, coupled with those of his torrid secretary, prove too much for his sanity. He turns, in his anguish, to assaulting young boys. Retaining, however, some vestiges of normal feelings, he persuades his minions to dress in women’s clothes. This explains his desire for female garments. As his neurosis matures we’ll better be able to decide whether he intended his boys to impersonate wife, patient or secretary."
S1006078,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Pure madness. No other reason.
S1006080,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"I trace the origins of his illness as far back as that first letter to The Guardian. From the startling ideas of Dr Goebbels on the function of the male sexual organ we pass quite logically to white golliwogs. An attempt, in fact, to change the order of creation – homesexuality slots in here dabbling in the black arts! The reported theft of the private parts of a well-known public figure ties in with this theory. We’ve phallic worship under our noses or I’m a Dutchman! (With a neigh of laughter.) When this is published I’ll make my fortune. My ‘documentary type’ novelette will go into twelve record-breaking reprints. I’ll be able to leave the service of the Commissioners and bask in the attentions of those who, like myself, find other people’s iniquity puts money in their purse."
S1006082,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I shan’t now ask Dr Prenticeto open our Mental Health Fair. (Pressing his lips together.) We’ll have to fall back upon one of the saner members of the Cabinet.
S1006085,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"He’s taken an overdose! We have here terrible evidence of conflict. His tormented mind, seeking release, has led him to attempt to destroy himself."
S1006088,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Just when one least expects it, the unexpected always happens. We must find him before it’s too late."
S1006097,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Possibly. His behaviour is so ridiculous one might almost suspect him of being sane.
S1006100,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Was she struggling?
S1006102,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Then a new and frightening possibility presents itself. The drugs in this box – (He lifts up the bright red pill-box.) may not have been used for suicide, but for murder. Your husband has made away with his secretary!"
S1006105,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Lunatics are melodramatic. The subtleties of drama are wasted on them. The ugly shadow of anti-Christ stalks this house. Having discovered her Father/Lover in Dr Prenticethe patient replaces him in a psychological reshuffle by that archetypal Father-figure – the Devil himself. Everything is now clear. The final chapters of my book are knitting together
S1006106,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,"Would you confirm, PRENTICE that your wife saw you carrying a body into the shrubbery?"
S1006108,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,I’m not interested in your explanations. I can provide my own. Where is your secretary?
S1006110,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,to Mrs PRENTICE,He killed her and wrapped her body in a sack. The word association is very clear.
S1006112,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Your answer is in accord with the complex structure of your neurosis.
S1006114,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,to Mrs PRENTICE,) He hopes for a resurrection. We’ve a link here with primitive religion. (To DR PRENTICE.) Why have you turned your back on the God of your Fathers?
S1006116,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You can’t be a rationalist in an irrational world. It isn’t rational. (Picking Up the wig and shoes.) Was it your intention to wear these for auto-erotic excitement?

S1006129,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,The time has come to call a halt to this Graeco – Roman hallucination. Is there a strait-jacket in the house?

S1006163,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,Such a touching demonstration of brotherly love is quite in key with the spirit of the age. Why did you arrest him?

S1006229,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,You imagine you’re a secretary. In fact you’re the leading player in one of the most remarkable and sinister stories of recent history. The extent to which you influenced your employer and contributed to his breakdown has yet to be measured.

S1006291,P005,C0034,DR RANCE,,The sergeant too may not exist. According to your wife he also appeared to her naked. For all we know he could be a type of incubus employed by Scotland Yard. He admitted that his brother was a figment of his imagination confirming my own law that the relations of apparitions are also apparitions. (In a firm voice.) What have you done with Geraldine Barclay?

S1005799,P005,C0035,MATCH,,"It’s a matter of national importance. Miss Barclay’s step-mother, a woman of otherwise unblemished character, died recently. Shortly before her death her name had been linked in a most unpleasant way with that of Sir Winston Churchill. Mrs Barclay’s association with the great man gave offence in some circles. However, the local council, composed by and large of no-nonsense men and women of the ‘sixties, decided in view of his war record to overlook Sir Winston’s moral lapse. Under expert guidance he was to be reintegrated into society. The task accomplished it became clear that the great man was incomplete. When the true facts got out the die-hards were in uproar. The press took up the story and it snowballed out of all proportion. At last – with the full support of the Conservative and Unionist Party the council decided to sue the heirs of Mrs Barclay for those parts of Sir Winston which an army-type medical had proved to be missing. The council’s lawyers obtained an exhumation order. This morning the coffin was opened in the presence of the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of this borough. Fainting women were held back as the official in charge searched high and low for council property. His efforts were not crowned with success. Mrs Barclay had taken nothing with her to the grave except those things which she ought to have done. At noon today the matter came to the attention of the police."
